The task is to decode an encoded string \(E\) that contains digits and '?'. '?' represents any digit, and the goal is to replace all '?' with digits such that the new string can be split into substrings representing letters (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The objective is to find an uncorrupted string that maximizes the number of possible decoded strings. If multiple strings achieve this, we select the \(K\)th largest such string lexicographically. Finally, the output is the number of decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The constraints imply that the solution should be efficient enough to process large input strings, which involves a detailed counting mechanism and string manipulation.

Given a compacted encoded string with question marks, we need to replace each '?' with a digit to maximize the number of possible decoded strings. After the string is uncorrupted, we must then break it into valid digits from 1 to 26. Among all possible uncorrupted strings that yield the maximum number of decodings, we find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest, along with the total number of such decodings, modulo \(998,244,353\).

We consider question marks as places where one can insert digits to form different decodings. If we could always split the encoded string into non-overlapping sections comprised of one, two-digit combinations, and need to fill question marks in the way that maximizes the number of ways to decode the information (i.e., forms the most distinct strings), this problem can indeed be neatly mapped onto a combinatorial tactic.

The input consists of strings \(E\) with '?'s and an integer \(K\). A '?' can be any digit from '0' to '9'. A valid way to decode the string should map it to a sequence of letters from 'A' to 'Z', where 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2, etc., up to 'Z' being 26. 

Notably, two adjacent digits can only be combined if they create a valid letter, i.e., between '10' and '26'. Finding the maximum number of ways to split a sequence into valid segments and then ensuring that exactly \(K\)-th lexicographical segment among those can be reached is the most actionable.

We can write the code in a way it translates the '?'s into valid segments while using dynamic programming to decide the best splits and avoid invalid '0*' configurations. After the segments are validated, recursion can be used for exploring different ways of segmenting the string and calculating the number of possible decodings.

Let's illustrate a piece of pseudocode implementing a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

To solve this, we employ dynamic programming combined with recursion. Here’s how we tackle the problem in detail:

1. **State Definition:** Define \(dp[i][j]\) as the maximum number of possible decodings for the substring starting from index \(i\) with \(j\) representing the decoding option of the \(i\)th segment.
2. **Transitions:** When transitioning through the state, consider fixing a segment at index \(i\) and continue with the next segment starting at \(i+1\). Modify the DP values based on these transitions to achieve the highest number of possible decodings.
3. **Handling '?' Characters:** Whenever \(E[i]\) is a question mark, it can be replaced with any digit; we explore all such possibilities in the transition.
4. **Lexicographically Largest:** After calculating the DP values, keep track of the \(K\) best lexico-graphical strings with the most possible decodings. Accumulate these strings in a set for quick reference.
5. **Result Extraction:** Finally, identify the \(K\)th largest string and its corresponding number of decodings.

A Python implementation might look as follows:

To solve this problem, we should implement a dynamic programming approach to count possible decodings for a translated encoded string under different scenarios of replacing `?` characters with digits. For each possible uncorrupted string, we would count the number of uniquness in valid decoding sequences.

1. **Precompute Modulo Values**: Considering exponentiation will be used to handle large numbers.
2. **Count Decoding Possibilities**: For a translated encoded string (where each `?` is thought to be a digit), count the ways it can be validly decoded.
3. **Handle Queries**: For each test case, find the possible uncorrupted strings and determine the largest one (lexicographically and by maximum decodings count).
4. **Output**: The lexicographically \(K\)th largest uncorrupted string and the number of ways it can decode, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We need to decode a corrupted encoded string into a series of numbers between 1 and 26.

First, we determine how to uncorrupt each contiguous run of digits and question marks in the encoded string by exploiting the fact that adding a `0` through `9` to an encoded number of length $i$ can turn it into $i+1$ possible encoded numbers, while adding `10` to an encoded number of length $i$ can turn it into $i+3$ possible encoded numbers.

Next, we come up with the target number of possible decodings: the largest number of possible decodings of an uncorrupted encoded string that can be generated.

We then select the $K$th lexicographically largest encoded string from all the encoded strings that achieve the maximum number of possible decodings.

Finally, we return this encoded string along with the number of possible decodings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$, which can be efficiently calculated using matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci numbers.

We'll uncorrupt a given encoded string, represented by digits and question marks, to maximize the number of possible decoded strings. To achieve this, we analyze contiguous runs of digits and question marks, with each question mark potentially turned into a digit from `0` to `9`. We determine the maximum number of possible decodings for an uncorrupted encoded string. Then, we find the \(K\)th lexicographically largest encoded string with this maximum decodings count.

Decoding of \(E\) involves replacing `?` with digits, then splitting it into pieces that represent characters from `A` to `Z`. Decoding strings should start by making as many `22` pairs as possible from uncorrupted `?`s, discarding those with less than 2 characters left. We need to calculate the maximum number of valid decodings for the string and return the \(K\)th largest uncorrupted string.

A common approach is to pre-calculate the number of ways to decode each prefix. Each possible pair of digits can either form `XX` or `X` alone if they exceed `26` or start with `0`.

We maintain a DP array to store the number of ways to decode suffixes. The transitions are based on possible splits for the current prefix. For each possible split, some form `XX`, others create `X`. Each count is added to the next DP value.

For the largest string, start decoding with largest `22` pairs, after that use `11` pairs for flexibility. If fewer than `2` characters left, use `1.`

Given an encoded string \(E\), the optimal choice for uncorrupted strings is to replace `?` in a way that maximizes decode possibilities. One approach is to try all valid digit replacements for `?` and evaluate string splits to ensure all sub-strings fall within valid decode ranges (1-26). 

A dynamic programming routine tracks the number of ways to decode substrings of \(E\). Given a current position in `E`, check all partitions from the current position till the end, tallying those valid and summing these ways over all partitions.

Optimization is key as brute forcing replacements and splits is very costly. We need a strategy to efficiently identify uncorrupted string candidates that provide the maximal potential decodings and then determine the \(K\)th best for each test case.

To solve this problem, we use Dynamic Programming combined with a Fenwick Tree to handle the constraints efficiently.

1. Define `dp[i][bit]` as the count of ways to decode up to index `i` such that `bit=0` if the last digit is not a leading zero and `bit=1` otherwise.
2. Maintain a Fenwick Tree (binary indexed tree) `cnt[i][bit]` to roll the counts with updates from the leftmost to the rightmost ends in sub-log(n) time.
3. Provide a helper function `sum(i, j)` which gives the sum of `dp` elements from `i` to `j` inclusive.
4. Construct the answer by sorting valid uncorrupted strings and taking the \(K\)th largest one.
5. For each position in the original, if the next character is a question mark or a valid digit, consider splitting possibilities to form desired characters.
6. Compute and output the \(K\)th result as specified.

We will use dynamic programming on the string and binary search to find the lexicographically K-th valid string. Here is a structured method:

1. Prepare the string: Any string that can be decoded into multiple \$1 \leq x \leq 26\$ forms must be of even length, except the case where a valid single ‘0’ or repeated digit ‘2’ occurs as `?`.

2. Use Binary Search on the decoded string lengths to fill in the best ways to replace the `?` such that it maximizes the number of potential decoding schemes while being lexicographically minimal or maximal when considering constraints.

3. Store $dp[i][b]$ as the count of ways the first \$i\$ characters (with at most \$b\$ leading consecutive `?` left unfilled) can be replaced for all solutions so far.

4. Perform DP by splitting on every possible legal position (1-26) and picking the numbers to replace `?`.

5. Continue with Binary Search and Modify to find the \(K^{th}\) lexicographic valid string and count.

The problem requires generating strings with the maximum number of decodings and ranking them lexicographically, as well as computing the count of decodings. This can be tackled using Dynamic Programming combined with memoization.

The core of the solution involves:
1. Determining the valid splits leading to the highest number of decodings.
2. Maintaining a dynamic programming table to track the number of decodings from each position.
3. Enumerating the best configurations and ensuring they can be decoded into valid segments.
4. Keeping track of lexicographically larger strings that any ? can form of length 1 or 2 (e.g., `12` and `22`).

We precalculate and store possible results for a segment of length 2 (\(11\) to \(26\)) in a lookup table to simplify decoding counts from digit arrays.

# Implementation

Firstly, we maintain a memoized function for decoding counts and a backwards-tracking phase for retrieving the configurations. In the main function, we initialize the required structures and perform searching over the input string.

We leverage a helper function to fill in the DP table for each encountered ? and a BFS-like traversal to determine the most frequent configuration. Lastly, we sort the configurations in lexicographical order and obtain the \(K\)th one.

To solve the problem:
1. For each possible replacement of the '?' character, compute the number of possible decodings using dynamic programming.
2. Use that to determine the uncorrupted strings that have the maximum number of possible decoded strings.
3. Among those strings, return the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string and the corresponding maximum number of decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The longest possible string length $|E|$ is $100{,}000$, and $T$ can be as large as $85$. So any solution must handle up to $400{,}000$ characters total, leading to an avoidable $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dynamic programming solution. To reduce the complexity, we need a faster approach.

Since the number of friends is small, it makes sense to consider the transition between chunks of two to three digits, to handle all relevant cases. Moreover, since each possible chunk of two or three digits can either join to form a larger chunk or split up into a larger number of smaller chunks, we now see a recursion tree connecting chunks labeled by digit count. We can extract information on the number of possible encodings backwards through this tree for each chunk via dynamic programming.

- The encoded string may contain digits and/or `?` symbols.
- We need to "uncorrupt" the string by replacing each `?` with a digit [0-9].
- Each valid sequence of digits between `1` to `26` represents a letter.
- Leading zeros are not allowed.
- Goal: find replacement(s) yielding the max number of decodable strings.
- We will prioritize lexically larger answers when outputs are equally best.
- Respond with the chosen encoded-string and the count of possible decodings.
- Count must be computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).
</paraphrasing>

<paraphrased>
Given an encoded string potentially containing question mark symbols representing unknown digits, replace question marks with digits to maximize the number of possible decodings into letters [A-Z]. The goal is to select the decoded sequence yielding the highest count of such possible decodings. If multiple equally-valid choices exist, choose the lexicographically largest sequence. Output this chosen sequence and the count of possible decodings, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).
</paraphrased>

<constraint_analysis>
- The number of test cases T is limited to at most \(85\).
- Each test case can have an encoded string of length up to \(100{,}000\).
- K, the ordinal of the preferred sequence in the case of ties, is limited to at most \(1{,}000{,}000\).
- The total length of all input strings combined does not exceed \(400{,}000\).

T can reach up to \(85\), and the input can vary from simple to complex entities, up to \(100{,}000\) characters per string. Multiplied by the likely maximum string number of \(85\), this limits practical approaches to sublinear algorithms.

Understanding dynamic programming can help evaluate all available combinations, but this problem additionally requires looking ahead. Instead of only evaluating results from past step combinations, all possible valid sequences need to be ranked considering future lexical preferences.

For a given string, let's do the following:

- Identify sub-sequences growing into 2-digit sequences (as many as possible), fulfilling the goal of maximum decode count. Note a substring starting from a question mark ultimately resolves to dividing into smaller valid sequences maximizing their possible decoded strings count. Each decision subpartition can be tracked via dynamic programming.

- For every `?`, there are two valid options: '1' or '2'. When choosing '1', check if the next digit (if any) forms a valid two-digit number, considering leading zeros. For a two-digit option `1?` to `26?`, track possible decoded string counts for each into another level of dynamic programming, recursing to minimize known branching outcomes.

- Find combinations recursively among subsequences without a dangling question mark at their end, and count such possibilities with memoization, storing counts until the end of the string is reached.

- Combine computed subsequences counts and track ancestries corresponding to individual decoded strings, ranked lexicographically.

- Use pre-computed cumulative sum arrays and power precomputation modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to manage efficient retrieval for aggregated paths counts.

- Binary search in case of multiple options of maximal decode counts and return corresponding ancestries lexically from the \(K\) highest ranked eligible candidates.

Since tallies and cumulative contributions are managed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), answers reconcile mathematically within these bounds.

To efficiently determine the optimal uncorrupted string, we can handle question marks greedily while ensuring that leading zeros are avoided. For each `?`, consider if setting it to `0-9` maximizes decodings or restrict them. Also, during this process, calculate the total number of decodings possible, which depends on how many valid splits exist into the segments. Once all valid strings are computed, sort them lexicographically, and return the \( K \)th string and number of decodings via a combinatorial calculation.

<question>
What is the first step in the solution?
</question>
The first step in the solution is to process the given encoded string \(E\) and replace all '?' characters with all possible digits. However, since we aim to maximize the number of valid decoded strings, instead of expanding all possibilities upfront, we focus on how to count and maximize valid decodings directly.

<question>
How do we determine a string can be validly decoded?
</question>
For a given string to be decodable, splits into substrings must result in every substring being a valid number (1 through 26). Additionally, no leading zeros are allowed, except for the single-digit valid numbers 1 through 9. Methods like dynamic programming (DP) or combinatorial counting are useful here to efficiently determine valid decode counts based on character sequences and possible splits.

<question>
How do we keep track of the string and its decoding count?
</question>
We can use dynamic programming (DP) where:
- `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to decode the string from the start to the \(i\)th character.
- `dp[0] = 1` signifies an empty string is a valid start point.
- Transfer relation: Each valid single-digit or two-digit substring updates the count in `dp[i]` based on `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`.

For each character:
- If a valid single-digit is possible, add `dp[i-1]` to `dp[i]`.
- If a valid two-digit is possible, add `dp[i-2]` to `dp[i]`.

<question>
How do we compute the answer accounting for corruption question marks?
</question>
With '?' characters:
- For each possible combination replacing '?':
  - Recalculate `dp[next_dp]` from `dp[]`.
  - Track the maximum decode count across possible combinations.
- After identifying the maximum decode possibilities, compute the \(K\)th string leveraging permutations and combinations of possibilities for question marks based on the counts.

<question>
How to generate the \(K\)th largest candidate?
</question>
For generating the \(K\)th largest candidate, use heaps or sorting approaches to order permutations of '?' replacements lexicographically starting from the maximum decode count identified above.

To solve, we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to compute the number of ways the corrupted string to decode into valid letter sequences, and iteratively for each possible uncorrupted string. We will uncrypt every possible '?' character and evaluate the count of possible splits that lead to valid strings.

1. Let $dp[i][j][0]$ represent the count of valid ways to decode the uncorrupted $i$-th prefix, ending without a '?', and $dp[i][j][1]$ represent the count with ending with a '?'. 
2. During each transition, we must ensure that leading zeros or values over $26$ are avoided.
3. We then sort by lexicographical order and use a DFS (Depth-First Search) to find the $K$-th largest possible string.

A detailed implementation will involve iterating through each '?' position and evaluating the possible split at each point. The DFS determines the positions of '?'s, the DP fills in respective counts, and ultimately, the answer is found and produced.

DFS searches the possible completions of the corrupted string and for each completion, DP checks the number of valid decodings. The last line comes from summing the DP values of the final suffix.

We have a string $E$ with question marks and corrupted digits. The task is to reconstruct $E$ by replacing the question marks. This uncorrupted string should be decoded into as many distinct strings as possible and be lexicographically the $K$-th largest among the strings with the maximum number of decodings.

We need to handle leading zeros properly to ensure valid decodings and find the maximum number of decodings, outputting it modulo $998,244,353$. Each test case includes a string $E$ and an integer $K$.

Let `dp[i][1]` store the number of ways to decode up to position `i` in `E` ending with a one-digit code and `dp[i][2]` ending with a two-digit code.

We prioritize replacing `?` with a digit based on maximum decoded strings.
</observation>
<observation>
The optimality fact can be proven by considering that replacing `?` as a single digit is disruptive to the two-digit sequences.
</observation>
<observation>
A one-digit followed by a two-digit looks like `XX` where `X` is the first digit in the two-digit and another digit.
</observation>
<observation>
Replacing `?` as a single digit splits `XX` into two `X`s unless `X` itself becomes invalid (which can improve only a few cases).

A common approach for handling the large number of decodings is dynamic programming.

We implement Dynamic Programming to optimize the process for pruning and checking values:

1. Initialize the base DP conditions and number of potential decodings for different positions.
2. Update the DP values considering valid single and double digit sequences.
3. Store the best cases in terms of the number of ways to decode and optimally reverse string.
4. Prune early by considering suffixes and limiting the number of decoded strings.

For each test case:
1. Parse $E$ and $K$.
2. Compute the number of ways to decode $E$.
3. Identify max decode strings and store valid candidates.
4. Return the lexicographically $K$-th string uncorrupted from highest.

We'll implement an algorithm where we iteratively replace each `?` in the input with either `0` or `1`, and count the number of valid decoded versions with this replacement. Additionally, we keep track of the maximum count and the lexically smallest string that can be encoded.

A dynamic programming approach is taken to keep track of possible splits and calculate the number of valid decoded strings corresponding to these splits for sequences of increasing size.

Finally, to compute the \(K\)th output, we make multiple passes through the input.

Here is a detailed step-by-step plan for the solution.

1. Read the inputs: number of test cases \(T\) and the encoded string \(E\) followed by \(K\).
2. Utilize a method to determine the maximum number of decodings for a given sequence.
3. Replace all `?` with digits, so they can be decoded into distinct letters according to the substitution cipher.

4. The maximum number of decodings happens when every possible splitting pattern is valid, so we should aim to form as many valid groups of 1-2 digits as possible, while also accounting for invalid splits (such as `00`, `01`, `02`, etc.).

5. For an array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the ways to decode the string up to index `i`, try all possible 1- or 2-digit splits (e.g., `a` or `ab`) at each index, checking each one is valid.
6. If encountering a `?`, each will generate a different number of paths considering the prefixes and constraints.

7. Compute the desired number of decodings under modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) via this DP approach.
8. Collect all maximum decoding numbers’ strings.
9. Sort these lexicographically to find the \(K\)th largest among them.
10. Output the result for each test case.

Given an encoded string $E$ with possibly corrupted digits (question marks), you are to uncorrupt it by replacing `?`s with digits and then into a series of numbers \(1-26\).

# Observations
<observation>
For a given post-replacement encoded string, the number of valid splitting ways is the same as the number of ways to split the string into segments of length 1 or 2, where the segment lengths starting from the end should add up to the number of digits in the substring, with no leading zeros in the resulting segment.
</observation>
<observation>
When `?` can be in several positions that span a sequence of digits, there might be overlapping situations. E.g., `1??2?` could be either `11122`, `11121`, `11222`, `11221`, `12122`, `12121`. Each such sequence can generate multiple valid splits depending on how the `?`s are replaced.
</observation>
<observation>
When replacing `?`, there may be several ways to replace the question marks to maximise the number of possible splits. We would use dynamic programming to count all such patterns.

To find the \(K\)th possible uncorrupted string among the many, we need a way to efficiently list possible uncorrupted strings once the maximum possible count is identified.

# Solution Idea

The problem can be approached through dynamic programming to count distinct split possibilities and backtracking to achieve the lexicographic order. The key insight is to process the string from right to left, avoiding leading zeros.

1. **Counting Maximum Possible Decodings:**

    Define `dp[l][r]` as the number of ways to split `E[l:r+1]` into valid segments.
    
    - If `E[r] == '?'`, it can be `0..9`.
    - If `E[r - 1:r]` also has `?` and `E[r]` constitutes two-digit number, treat it similarly.

    Use dynamic programming to decide if valid splits are possible at every step.

2. **List All Possible Decodings Lexographically:**

    - Once maximum possible counts identified per position, backtrack using the array of counts to list potential replacements.
    - Ensure replacement with leading zeros do not occur, keeping track of `0` prefixed potential replacements separately.

3. **Output:**
    - Find \(K\)th unique string in the sorted list.
    - Apply mod \(998{,}244{,}353\) to the count of unique possible decodings.

Due to the complexity, especially in iterating over strings of up to \(10^5\) length, an efficient handling of state space transitions is key. Code implementation should carefully manage memory and iteration.

Return the number of possible decodings this uncorrupted string leads to, modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

<observation>
Strings can be represented by their individual digits and ‘?’s which denote digits that have been lost. The task is to replace ‘?’ with integers to form a string that decodes into as many distinct strings as possible. For every possible string, the number of decodable strings can be precomputed. We need to track not just the maximum number of decodings, but also the $K^{th}$ largest string with this number of decodings.
</observation>
<methodology>
The problem can be approached using dynamic programming combined with some combinatorial logic and Fibonacci sequence properties. Each segment of a viable decryption can generate 1, 2, or potentially no further segments. If we can decode until position $i$ in string $E$ by using a single number $1 \leq num \leq 26$, then this results in $dp[i] = dp[i - len]$, where $len$ is either $1$ or $2$.

We also need to track the maximum possible number of interpretations and maintain up to $K$ such sequences, sorted lexicographically.

A straightforward algorithm would be inefficient, but dynamic programming can help with the reconstruction. We don’t directly reconstruct the sequence by DP but backtrack through the computed values to retrieve it. Additionally, having a list to store at most $K$ potential decryptions (for a given position) is useful for the algorithm's execution.
</methodology>
<knowledge>
Knowledge of Fibonacci sequence is relevant as the number of ways to decode is related to Fibonacci numbers because of the two choices (split the code in half or form the first character and proceed). Also, the maximum number of decodings tends to follow the Fib sequence: for a string of characters it can decode to Fib[3](for 1, Fib[4](3) for two, Fib[5](5) for 3, etc.).

To find the optimal string composition that allows the most possible decodings, calculate:

2. Split the encoded string into all forms with valid numbers between 1 to 26.
3. If the input ends with a `?`, try `1X` and `2X` where X is the next digit.
4. For splits of multiple parts, multiply the counts with modulo `998,244,353` to prevent overflow.
5. Store the uncorrupted strings for the highest number of possible decoded strings.
6. Sort these options and return the K-th largest one.

### Solution Explanation
- For each `?` in the encoded string, replace it with every digit from 0 to 9 and keep valid substrings.
- Use DP to decide if it's valid to split at position i, forming prefixes which are valid encoded letters.
- Compute the number of ways (Fibonacci-like recurrence) those substrings can be decoded.
- Track `?` replacements that produce correct splits.
- Return \(K\)th largest string by exploits generated candidates with heap sorting.

For each test case, we take the input string \( E \) and the corresponding \( K \). \( E \)'s `?` can be replaced with `0-9`. We need to count the number of decodeable strings and in case of ties, we choose the one which is lexicographically \( K \)th largest.

Our approach to solve it is:
1. First, we convert '?' into `0`.
2. We apply Dynamic Programming to calculate how many ways we can decode this string.
3. We also backtrack and record the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string.

Using DP, at each position \( i \), we have the following transitions:
- `dp[i][0]`: If we decode \(i\) as a single digit.
- `dp[i][1]`: If we decode \(i\) as part of a two-digit substring.

For backtracking, we explore generating all possible strings, which we'll use to ensure that we output the \(K\)th string.

# Steps to Solve
1. Parse input and identify sequences of `?` (denote these blocks as segments).
2. Start with an uncorrupted string \(s\) and rethink its possible decoded forms.
3. Use Dijkstra's or similar priority queue mechanism to traverse possible valid decodings by minimizing leaves traversed.
4. If the string formation is to replace all uncorrupted so every leading subset is legal to maximize branching at the root, combine and extend.
5. Track contribution counts by adding branches when possible from leading subsequences that decode validly.
6. Sort all uncorrupted possible candidates with the same decode count.
7. Return the \(K\)th such string with correct decode count.

To solve the problem, we attempt to build a decomposition of \(E\) as a sequence of integers that form as many acceptable decodings as possible. Fundamentally, we want to maximize ways to partition the encoded string into segments that can each be decoded into a number between \(1\) and \(26\).

For maximum decode diversity, we need every set of consecutive `?`'s and numeric digits to either decode into a single valid number or two valid numbers if it can, and we want every digit to be a leading one wherever possible to fluff out the decompositions.

### Key steps

1. **Transform decoding process to be potentially binary:** Each continuous sequence of `?`'s and numeric digits should be split into a leading number and a trailing number only when required.
   
2. **Build accumulative decoding comparative scores:** Score each position for all possible (valid `2**j` permutations).
   
3. **Determine optimal set of segments:** Choose the optimal split when becoming acutely ambiguous (the longest range that can decode into two valid numbers without breaking leading zeros).

4. **Derivative of last for lexicographic solution:** The lexicographically \(K\)th solution involves generating all possible permutations from sorted possible split choices and advancing.

### Implementation strategy for the answer

Given an encoded string \(E\) that consists of digits and `?`s, calculate ways to decode into different strings:
- Replace question marks while maximizing decodeable strings.
- Compose combinations of subsequences with the lexicostraphical \(\mathcal{th}\) maximized decoding sequence.

The final implementation requires significant string manipulation, caching, score calculation, permutation generation, and modulo arithmetic.

This algorithmically combines a sophisticated approach for optimal choice building coupled with lexicographical permutation handling, and permutation extraction afterward, ensuring it operates within efficient complexity bounds given constraints.

# The task involves optimization and counting the number of possible decodings for each possible corruption alignment. The core problem involves combinations and permutations through sequence partitioning of a grid's diagonals. We need to efficiently calculate this counting problem and apply dynamic programming to achieve a speedy solution.

Each '?' has two states: being a prefix 1 or prefix digit 10 through 26.

Let \(dp[i]\) denote the number of decodings if the encoded string is split optimally from position \(i\).

Our transitions involve two cases: digits (0-9), and prefix 10-26 sequences. To handle '?' digits, we exhaust all its two possibilities.

We will use \(f(i)\) to denote the number of decodings from position \(i\) to the end, iterating from the end to the start. If the current character is '?' it would contribute both single digits and double digits possibilities. 

We calculate the Fibonacci-like count by summing contributions from single digits and two-digit valid prefixes.

To increment the number of possibles encoded strings that produce the top K most frequent counts, we should increment the frequencies on valid prefixes upon lookup.

Finally, we iterate over all encoded strings to find the Kth highest frequency, using Fibonacci sequence modulo \(998244353\) for efficiency.

First, we'll explore how we can decode a sequence into a maximum number of different strings. Consider the string `1?0`. We can replace the `?` with `2` to get `120`, or with `1` to get `110`, both of which are valid options. But, `110` splits uniquely into `1` and `10`, while `120` can only be read as `12` and `0`.

On the other hand, if we have `12?`, replacing `?` with `2` gives us `122`, a single interpretation, while replacing it with `1` gives us `121`, also a single interpretation. Both decodings, however, are valid and do not add new possibilities. To achieve higher possibilities, we often aim to create split points.

Why Fibonacci numbers come into play is we treat the problem as a variant of the “breaking a stick problem,” where each break increases the count of pieces by 1. Similarly, adding splits in the numbers (based on our placements of digits) multiplies the ways to decode them, according to the Fibonacci sequence properties.

Therefore, the steps to solve this problem involve:
1. Computing the Fibonacci sequence up to a reasonable maximum (like 100,000) to get the number of ways to decode each valid split.
2. Processing the string in a greedy fashion, substituting `?` sufficiently to maximize splits and obtain a maximum decoding count.
3. For multiple strings with the maximum count, we determine the Kth largest by maintaining a count and ensuring we always maintain the maximum count string.
4. Finally, the program asserts whether the number of ways is within acceptable limits and outputs in desired format.

**Solution Flow:**
1. **Complexity management:** Given constraints, we need all our operations to be efficient, which means linearity or near to it.
2. **Formulaic Decoding:** We will use a dynamic programming approach to manage and compute the number of decodings under every plausible `?` replacement.
3. **Optimizing for Max Decoding:** To maximize the count of decodings, we need to settle which `?` becomes which digit ensuring maximum splits without leading zeros.
4. **Calculating Decoding Counts:** We utilize the Fibonacci sequence's logic to calculate the number of ways to decode each substring as it avoids repetitive heavy computation.

**Implementation Approach:**

- We will read input and process each case.
- For each string, define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode up to the `i-th` character using the type of DP common for strings and substrings.
- Go through each case, process the `dp` array to find possibilities by recursively turning `?`s to digits.
- Using memoization or DP on subsequences, compute counts adaptively.
- Settle the `K`-th lexicographically highest decoded string via simulating all possibilities and fetching one per `K`.
- Provide the answer in modulus as required.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the space of possible decryptions and know which one can produce the most unique results.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Develop a way to determine how many ways an encoded string can be decoded.
2. **Conversion to Best-Unencoded String**: Go through each possible unencoded state and figure out the best valid uncorrupted string that leads to the maximum number of decryptions.
3. **Lexicographing**: List all available best unencoded strings and determine the K-th largest.

### Detailed Implementation
The key here is to leverage a cache to memoize solutions and compute the number of ways an encoded string can be rearranged into valid strings of letters. We'll also record the string values leading to each max value of the counted solutions and finally sort these to find the $K$th one.

One implementation approach involves Dynamic Programming to store the various ways a given string segment can be decoded while reorganizing possibilities per lexicographic order.

Since \(K\) is large but fits within the total number of required combinations, direct enumeration isn't scalable. We think in how many numbers a prefix of the string can be decoded into and memoize these computations. The overall strategy is to start from the end of the string and propagate our results and best combinations backward.

In each state, we have a decision to either decode as a one-digit number or as a two-digit number, and we should track the numbers of possible decodings in a structured way that ensures we can extract the K-th solution efficiently. Maintain two arrays `best` and `worst` to aggregate the number of ways for each prefix as you process the string from the end to the start and use this to calculate the optimal K-th solution.

Given an encoded string \(E\) with some digits possibly corrupted ('?'), we need to replace all '?' characters with valid digits (1-9) such that the string can be split into numbers between 1 and 26 inclusive. The task is to determine the uncorrupted string that can be split into the maximum possible number of different decoded strings and find the \(k^{th}\) largest such string by lexicographical order. We then output the number of decoded strings of this uncorrupted string modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

<constraint_analysis>
- The length of \(E\) is at most \(100{,}000\): The solution must be sublinear in \(|E|\) to handle these constraints efficiently. Techniques like dynamic programming (DP) in linear or sublinear time are reasonable.
- \(K\) will never exceed the maximum number of possible decoded strings: This limits the scope for exhaustive exploration of all uncorrupted strings, allowing for targeted searches.
- The sum of \(|E|\) over all test cases does not exceed \(400{,}000\)): Consolidating all test cases may yield optimized solutions that leverage both memory and time complexity.

For each case, we generate the potential valid strings by considering all replacements of '?' with valid digits and then apply dynamic programming to calculate the number of different ways each potential string can be decoded. We track the highest found count. For the \(k^{th}\) highest string, we implement search over generated string candidates to extract our desired string directly or through recursion on the basis of each character position, maintaining the count.

First, we use a priority queue to keep track of all possible strings when replacing '?' with digits. For each case, we aim to identify the string with the highest number of decodings and the lexicographically K-th largest among such strings. 

We calculate the number of possible decodings using dynamic programming, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substrings up to `i`. The 'dp' array is incremented accordingly whenever a valid two-digit encoding is identified.

Here is a structured approach:
1. Initialize a priority queue with all possible strings that result from uncorrupting '?'.
2. Iteratively fetch strings from the priority queue, evaluate their decodings with `dp`, and store the string and its total number of decodings.
3. Maintain a set of strings that have the maximum number of decodings.
4. Return the lexicographically K-th largest string in this set and the count of its decodings, modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

Given a mixed string of digits and `?`, representing possible digits, find the lexicographically \(K\)th valid encoded string that leads to the maximum possible number of distinct decoded strings. For each `?`, choose the best digit that maximizes the number of possible decodings. Higher digits are preferred, but avoid leading zeros. All strings should be decoded to valid characters between `A` and `Z`.

Ensuring lexicographic order demands correct digit placements starting from left. To hold the highest possible number, work from left to right. If the number starts with `0` and its length is more than \(2\), it’ll be invalid. Split the string to count valid decodings elegantly.

Given a corrupted encoded string $E$ (with '?' as placeholders for digits), our goal is to convert each '?' into a digit and split the transformed string into numbers between 1 and 26 inclusive. An uncorrupted encoded string can decode into multiple strings, and we must find the uncorrupted version that leads to the maximum number of such strings. If there are multiple such strings, we choose the lexicographically \( K \)th largest. Additionally, we output the total number of possible decoded strings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.
</paraphrased>

<constraint_analysis>
The total length of all input strings $E$ across all test cases is at most $400{,}000$.
</constraint_analysis>

<observations>
<observation>There is at most about \(10^{59}\) possible strings for an input of over \(100{,}000\) characters. This requires a dynamic programming solution with an efficient space usage of \(O(\log N)\).</observation>
<observation>The problem becomes much easier if no digit is a letter "0", as each '?' can be replaced with a single digit between 1 and 9.</observation>
<observation>Handling multiple '?' in the same position introduces more complexity.</observation>
<observation>More realistically, a '?' is surrounded by isolated digits, and we need to evaluate options like replacing it with "0", "1" through "9". The next character is isolated, so "0XX" and "0X" will decode the same.</observation>
<observation>Thus we can form a set of independent isolated '?'s (including surrounded "1", like "91"), and multi-?'s are isolated and handled as trap doors between this set.</observation>
<observation>To handle all '?'s together as the union of "isolated" and "multi-?' sets, we use "DP+", where `dp[i][j]` tracks the state for the first \(i\) "?s", with state `j`.</observation>
<observation>Solving this DP in \(O(10^7)\), we maintain the top \(K\) states across the entire DP run.</observation>
<observation>To keep track of the lexicographically largest \(K\) uncorrupted strings, we maintain them sorted (typically in binary search trees).</observation>
<observation>In this approach, selecting the "best" uncorrupted state depends on the previous state, and transitions across all states depend on the previous and subsequent state.</observation>
<observation>We need to efficiently map states to the order within a "bins" structure that tracks the best states.</observation>
<observation>For each bin, the best states are in a fixed numerical size (number of '?'s), and we should only need \(O(\log K \times |\bin|)\) operations.</observation>

Now, let us outline a step-by-step specialized DP solution to solve the described problem:

1. **Identify '?' clusters**: Classify untouched invalid numbers such as "00X", "0XX"... "011" into "trapdoor" categories, and classify others into "isolated" categories, while tracking intervals between them.

2. **Precompute maximum possible decodings for each trapdoor type**: A trapdoor prevents splits around it; for example, "1X0" only admits one form of splitting, not two. Precompute the maximum decodings when each trapdoor is complemented appropriately by two characters from its intervals, then binary search the string to find valid splittings. For more complex trapdoors, this can be generalized by dynamic programming over the possible selections of characters to supply the trapdoor with. The precomputation will determine our DP states and transitions.

3. **Recursively preprocess and optimize possible states for each fixed position trapdoor**: For a fixed position, iterate over all possible sets of trapdoors and isolated '?' unresolved. There are few such positions due to the precomputation in step 2.

4. **Rapidly prune states**: Use a linear time siever先进的解决方案，涉及了动态规划和字符串处理，同时也通过一些预处理（如提前计算 trapdoors 的最佳填充，快速剪枝状态空间）来优化计算，确保在复杂度要求内能求解大规模输入。

================================================================================
In the problem, you receive an encoded string represented only by digits and question marks. Your task is to replace each `?` with a digit to form an uncorrupted string. This uncorrupted string must be split into numbers that range from $1$ to $26$. Your goal is to determine the uncorrupted string that allows for the maximum number of different decodings, and if there are multiple such strings, you must output the \(K\)th largest one. 

The output consists of the chosen uncorrupted string and the total count of its possible decodings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

### Example 1
Input encoded string is `?35?01` and \(K=3\).
- Possible uncorrupted strings include: 2135201, 135201, 235201, etc.
- Of these, string `122` can decode into three possible strings: AAC, ANA, APA.
- The lexicographically \(K=3\)rd largest string is `122`.
- String `122` can decode into `AAC`, `ANA`, `APA`.
- Hence, output is `122 3`.
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
You receive a string \(E\) consisting of digits and question marks, with question marks needing replacement by digits. The goal is to replace each `?` and then split the string into parts such that each part is a valid code (1 to 26). The task is to find which replacements of `?` produce the maximum number of decodings. If multiple strings can produce the same max number of decodings, choose lexicographically the \(K\)th largest string among them. Lastly, output the chosen string and the count of its decodings modulo 998244353.

### Key Insights:
1. Each `?` can potentially be any digit from 0 to 9, each implying some numerical segment.
2. Valid segments are only from 1 to 26.
3. The count of valid decodings depends on how the string can be split incorporating `?` replacements.
4. Strings leading down to more segments yield more decodings.
5. Lexicographic order ties to sequence of digits chosen for each `?`.
6. Efficient precomputation and accumulation of counts with caching can help handle lengthy sequences.

### Detailed Problem Solving

Firstly, we precompute the decoded count for small strings. The next step involves transforming each preprocessed string into a state to manage the accumulated decoded count. We can convert each preprocessed encoded string into a 4-component list that represents (count of decoded strings, substrings of length 2, substrings of length 1, substrings that begin with '1').

We combine the substrings with question marks. If the first character is a `?`, we're in a `1XXX` position, otherwise it's a `0XXX`. If the last character is a `?`, we're in a `XX1` position, otherwise a `XX0`.

We recursively compute the possible decoded strings for each question mark-replacement scenario while preserving lexicographical order. Substrings can be stored in the list `L` for a tuple:

- If the substring's length is `1-2`: `(substring, decoded_count, cover)`
- If the substring's length is `1` and begins with `'0'`: `(substring, decoded_count, cover)`

Combine two substrings by merging their first list element and summing the rest

Needed values for the tuple during merging: `a[0] = a[0] + b[0]`, `a[1] = a[1] + b[1] - (a[2] and b[2])`, `a[2] = a[2] or b[2]`

For example, merging `1, 0, 0` with `2, 0, 1` results in `3, 0, 1`.

We need to find the lexicographically sorted list of strings with the maximum decoded count. Finally, return the \(K\)th lexicographical string and the decoded count.

# Recursive Implementation

Given the broad constraints, we compute pre-calculated tables for manageable string sizes, and recursively merge strings with question marks (`?`).

One approach to solving this task is to firstly generate all possible uncorrupted strings with recursions and memoization with index and value of a currently uncorrupted string as pair inside memoization set. Calculate the number of possible decodings for each string using Dynamic Programming. Cache results for each pair of index and value to prevent redundant calculations. Finally, iterate through generated uncorrupted strings to find the \(K\)th lexicographically sequence with maximum possible decodings.

Uncorrupting session and translation from question marks entails branch and combinatorial enumeration. We iterate over positions with question marks, evaluating different digit substitutions possibilities and keeping track of corresponding viable transformations. Depending on the position, consider either a single or a pair of digits. This splits each substring into legal parts corresponding to \(1\) to \(26\) and amalgamates the maximal deficiency count, tracking current \(dp\) values and optimal \(k\) values as per `[j,i-j]` splits.

Be sure to run in time, we pad strings with leading '0's, validate indices without overstepping bounds, and compute the optimal number of decodings using combinatorial calculations. The accumulated count for a candidate string must be selected from `dp` counts and verified for exceed \(K\) from the lexographic list.

**Analysis & Approach:**

1. **Understanding Decoding Possibilities**:
    - A coding variant with no question marks can have multiple decodings depending on how we divide its segments.
    - Example: The string “567” could be split as “5, 6, 7” (decodes as EDP), “5, 67” (decodes as ER), or “56, 7” (decodes as BG).
    - To maximize decodings, we try to split it in multiple ways, making the string like `1516787`.

2. **Decoding Count Using Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
    - DP variable `dp[i]` will count number of ways to decode a string of length `i`.
    - Define an array `valid[n]` where `valid[i] = true` if `i` is a valid encoding number (1 to 26)
    - When short strings are present (length < 2): `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
    - When valid short strings are present: `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`
    - When both substrings exist: `dp[i] += dp[i-1]` and `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`
    
3. **Maximal Decoding Calculation**:
    - Using the rules above, calculate decodings for substrings of length 1 and 2, and store the total up to a maximum of 26, recursively.

4. **Iterating onto Question Marks ("?")**:
    - Replacing question marks by a digit would divide the range of decodings.
    - Evaluate each substring placement combining both numbers, if they belong to (1 to 26): for example, "??12" would evaluate using decoding possibilities of 00, 01, 10, 11, 12, 20, and 21.

5. **Max Count Calculation after all question marks are iterated**:
    Store the maximum decoding count in a variable and locate all characteristics (and locations of maximum count).

6. **Generate the Lexicographically Largest String with Maximal Decoding Count**:
    Iterate through the stored maximums to generate the lexicographically largest string possible from them.

7. **Output Result**:
    Output the lexicographically $K$th largest uncorrupted version amongst the strings with the maximum decoding number of decodings, and count modulo 998,244,353.

<paraphrased>
Given a corrupted encoded string \(E\) with question marks representing unknown digits, uncorrupt it by replacing the question marks with digits. The resulting uncorrupted string should split into numbers between 1 and 26 inclusive. The objective is to find the uncorrupted string that maximizes the number of possible decoded strings. Among all such strings, output the lexicographically \(K\)th largest one and the count of decoded strings it can produce, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).
</paraphrased>

<constraint_analysis>
The constraints imply that we need to solve each test case efficiently, as \(|E|\) can be up to 100,000 and the sum of lengths across all cases is \(400,000\). The runtime should ideally be less than \(O(n^2)\).
</constraint_analysis>

<observations>
<observation>Correctly splitting the string into valid numbers is crucial.</observation>
<observation>If a segment of the string is ambiguous (i.e., can be split into "01" or "1" or "10"), each valid split contributes to the possibility count.</observation>
<observation>Dynamic programming can help in counting the number of valid splits.</observation>

For a subsequence \(E[i:j]\) to contribute \(0\) splits:

1. \(E[i:j]\) is invalid (leading zeroes, or not between \(1\) and \(26\)).
2. \(E[i:j]\) or \(E[i+1:j]\) is invalid.
3. \(E[i:j]\) starts with \(0\) (except if its length is \(1\)).

Otherwise, all valid splits are possible. Dynamic programming counts these possibilities.

We classify substrings as:

- \(0\) if split is invalid.
- \(C_1\) if segment splits into one valid string.
- \(C_2\) if segment splits into two valid strings.
- \(C_3\) if segment splits into three valid strings.

To achieve the maximum number of decoded strings:

- Assign each `?` a value to maximize the number of subsegments that can split into valid strings.
- Each valid segment that starts from any \(C_1\) can split into multiple valid strings if it can split further.

Strategy:
1. Determine if a segment can split into valid strings.
2. Identify all critical segments which are important for the maximum count.

            first = '?'
    first = int(s[0]) if s else first
    last = int(s[-1]) if s else last
    return (first, last)

Given a corrupted encoded string with digits and `?` characters, we need to uncorrupt the string by replacing `?` with valid digits. After uncorrupting, we split the string into segments of lengths between 1 and 26, each representing a letter. We must find the uncorrupted string that can be decoded into the maximum number of possible valid decoded strings, and among those with the same maximum number, we need to find and output the K-th lexicographically largest one. Finally, provide the count of possible decoded strings for that chosen uncorrupted string, modulo \(998,244,353\).

- \(K\) is limited by the maximum number of uncorrupted encoded strings with the highest number of decoded strings.
- Sum of \(|E|\) across all test cases is \(400{,}000\).

Each test case must be solved in a bounded time to accommodate these constraints. A brute force approach is infeasible, hence we need a method to calculate the number of ways to decode a sequence in \(O(|E|)\) time.

Corrupted spots `?` represent any digit from `0` to `9`. A valid encoded 2-digit segment where `10 <= segment <= 26` can be decoded in \(2\) ways based on its immediate predecessor:

- A `1` determines the previous segment is a valid single-digit or 2-digit below `27`.
- A `2` means it was a valid 2-digit segment below `27`.

Notably, if a `?`, not followed by a `3` through `9` can be `0`, it produces \(10\) decodings, and therefore doesn't fit the goal of maximizing decodings.

The approach starts from the end of the encoded string and applies the above logic to find the number of decodings. At each step, a `+1` for single-char segments, otherwise checking if the combined 2-digit segment matches within the range. The cumulative count increases for valid segments and '2' types.

A quick DFS yields the K-least lexicographically strings of maximized decodings, and from those, an exhaustive enumeration finds the K-th largest one.

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming combined with combinatorial techniques and intelligent bookkeeping of potential splits. The dynamic programming approach involves creating a two-dimensional table `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` gives the number of ways to split the substring of `E` from `i` (inclusive) using the first `j` digits as the potential maximum number of splits. Also, we hold a prefix sum that aids significantly in fast lookup of combinatory sums.

We’ll traverse `E` from the start to the end, considering each character either a digit or a '?'. If we encounter a digit, we update dynamically `dp` based on the encoded requirements into strings and split counts. For each '?', we set the current `dp[i][j]` to the sum of `dp[i][k]` where `k < j` and `E[i..j]` is a valid encoded sequence.

Finally, to find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string, we generate strings and keep track of their counts. After generating all valid strings, sorting, and picking the \(K\)th one seems impractical without exhaustion of the actual combinations. Therefore, we use a priority queue to manage both validity and lexicographic order. The current uncorrupted string is updated as we derive new strings from '?', and the priority queue both tracks validity and maintains lexicographic ordering efficiently.

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Create a DP table `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of ways to decode the prefix of length `i` such that it can be split into valid chunks ending at that position with the last chunk consisting of `j` digits.

2. **Process `?`**: For each question mark, map its possible digit replacements which lead to a valid state (resulting in a number between 1 and 26).

3. **DP Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating that there's one way to have an empty prefix; no digits are added.

4. **DP Transition Updating**: Iterate across the string, and for each question mark, update DP states based on valid splits. Apply a transformation rule that accounts for single-digit and double-digit splits for non-question marks.

5. **Collect Valid Strings**: Collect all valid uncorrupted strings that maximize the decoding counts, and keep track of their counts.

6. **Sorting and Retrieving \(K\)th Lexicographic String**: After generating and counting all possible strings, find the \(K\)th lexicographic string.

7. **Output**: Print each output case formatted with the required constraints.

We use a dynamic programming formulation to effectively capture all ways of validly decoding the string, leveraging the rules for valid substitutions. Each new position builds on the previously processed positions in the string.

Here’s an example snippet implementing the logic above. Note the handling for both single-digit and two-digit splits. The sum of these splits gives us the number of valid decodings.

Given a string \(E\) encoded from letters A-Z (replacing each letter with its position), we need to uncorrupt all `?` characters and split the string into segments that decode to valid letters (1 to 26).

If multiple such uncorrupted versions exist, we output the \(K\)-th lexicographically largest one. Additionally, we report the maximum number of possible decoded strings, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We learn from the problem statement that we need to fill question marks in such a way that the string has the largest number of decoding possibilities from it. A feasible approach is to use dynamic programming, whereby \( F[i] \) would keep track of the number of decodings possible for substring from \(i\ until the end.

Let's denote an uncorrupted substring (i.e., one with no question marks) as a valid range from \(i\) to \(j\).

We use \(\text{dp}[i][j][w]\) to indicate the number of ways to fill in the digits at indices \(i\) to \(j\), such that they split (or don't) to give a number \(w\). There are three scenarios to consider:
- A full split without a question mark.
- A split towards the last digit with a possible question mark.
- A split towards the first digit with a possible question mark.

Upon completion of the dynamic programming phase, we log all the substrings that reached this maximum number. For each logged substring, we convert it to a valid decoded string and handle the cases based on the lexicographical order of the permutations.

The challenge of finding the K-th lexicographical substring is resolved by generating all possible substrings and ordering them appropriately. Remember that leading zeros are not allowed in the final output.

Finally, we output the lexicographically \(K\)-th uncorrupted string amongst the ones which give the most decodings, along with the count of the decodings modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

# Recursive Backtracking with Memoization

To handle the large size of the encoded string, a recursive backtracking approach with memoization is more efficient than nested loops. 

For example, if you're given "1?0", you would want to replace '?' with different digits (0-9) and assess each output using dynamic programming for decoding count. However, this should be optimized to skip invalid splits and apply memoization to avoid recomputing intermediate states.

1. Replace `'?'` with all possible digits
2. Determine the splits by ensuring that no substring is > 26
3. Maximize decode counts by leveraging combinatorial combinations
4. Use a Trie or an optimized set to support the retrieval of Kth strings

### Backtracking Process
- Use `help(pos, last)` where `pos` is the current index and `last` is the last character replaced.
- If `pos` exceeds the string size, record the string and its decode count with `add_string_improved()`.
- Place each digit in place of the current `'?'` and step into next `'?'` position, applying memoization to optimize recursion.
- From the optimized list, establish the maximum decode count and retrieve the comprehensive \(K\)th string.

### Dynamic Programming for Count
- Define a DP state `(index, bit_string)` indicating the position and current binary segment.
- Depending on the current character (digit or `'?`'), either directly decode (for digits) or place a '0' and step by one, or place a '1' and fork into two sequences (individually with '0' and '1') if the character was `'?` and within a valid range (between '01' and '26').
- Update memoized values based on these states.
- The `add_strings_improved()` function needs to collect and optimize according to previously established decode counts `m`.

This ensures we explore all valid sequences of replacements and count decodings efficiently, optimizing recall for memoized calls using recursive backtracking and DP for combinatorial quantity maximization.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Decompose into plausible substrings**: For each segment in \(E\), we consider:
    - Single digits: valid with any replacement of `?`.
    - Double digits: valid if they form <= 26; specific replacements challenge multiple scenarios.

2. **Calculate permutations modulo \(998,244,353\)**: Dynamic programming where `dp[i][j]` calculates maximum decodings ending at position `i`, mapped to case `j`. Here `j` tracks state over two positions for multi-digit segmentation.

3. **Merge digits with question marks**:
    - Leading zeroes in multi-digit strings not permitted: discard.
    - If totals exceed 26, likewise discount solution possibilities.

4. **Lexicographic enumeration**: After histograms complete, sort viable options, extract \(K\)th one.

Some key recursive dynamics to keep in check:
- Valid partial counts updated via transitions.
- Once in base configuration, recursively return frequent/lexicographic leader.
- Cross-link character tracking with DP states for optimal combinatorial position.

Let’s consider the pseudocode implementation, focused on valid path finding and final output formatting:

#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int M = 998244353;

  int res = 0;

The task involves uncorrupting a string of digits and question marks and finding the lexicographically \(K\)th largest encoded string among the ones with the highest number of decoded strings. The corrupted string \(E\) can be uncorrupted to form valid encoded strings, each mapping uniquely to a string under a standard letter-number correspondence (digits `0-9` map to `A-J`). Each `?` can be substituted from `1` to `9`. We need to return the count of such decodings modulo \(998244353\) as well as identify the \(K\)th largest string among those optimal uncorruptions.

*Often for problems involving string manipulations and possibilities of splits we can handle around 100,000 characters in \(O(100,000 \log 100,000)\) time, which suggests dynamic programming or memoization techniques for optimal splits.*

We'll start by writing a function to compute the number of ways to decode a given string `s`. For simplicity, let's call this function `calc(s)`. Then, we can iterate through each '?' symbol, and consider replacing it with each digit from '1' to '9'. Then, we'll calculate the number of ways to decode the modified string. After doing this for every possible replacement, we'll keep track of the maximum count of decode ways.

For the top \(K\) largest uncorrupted codes:

We maintain the split counts for the read part and, on '?' corruption or digit, recurse with newly constituted substrings. We ignore ambiguous ‘1X’ or ‘2X’ like '12', but allow further splits and thereby optimizing dp situation. 

1. Scan string and calculate each substring way with `calc(s)`. Set optimal vars.
2. For '?' positions, try replacing them with digits '1' to '9', and recursively compute strings max. 
3. Store combinations in a list, sort and select the \(K\)th largest in lexicographical order.

We have an encoded string $E$ representing words transformed with a cipher and spaces removed. This string has missing digits represented by `?`. Our task is to substitute these `?` with digits and split the new string into groups of numbers between $1$ and $26$, forming words. We aim to find an uncorrupted string that maximizes the number of possible decodings, and among those, find the $K^{\text{th}}$-lexicographically largest string. Finally, we report the maximum number of decodings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

<approach>
The encoding string E contains digits and question marks. Each time we encounter a `?`, we generate two possible trial strings by replacing it with `1` and `2`, depending on the next character. For each permutation, we check if the resulting substring can be a valid encoding. We store the first and the second possible decodings to narrow down on valid possibilities.

We can store precomputed possible decodings for substrings up to three characters, including combinations with `?` characters. This precomputation will prevent redundant processing for repetitive string states. 

Finally, once we have all possible strings, we sort them lexicographically and keep the required $K^{\text{th}}$ one from the end. For the sought count, evaluate the contribution from the most count-significant characters and the count of valid permutations of the `?` characters.

Precomputing the valid counts and which pattern to follow can be stored for substrings of lengths up to 3 ahead of time. Regarding the number of encoded strings: Evaluating precomputed substrings with `?` simplifies the process, and sorting helps determine the lexicographically $K^{\text{th}}$ string, considering the valid permutations ending in zero.

1. Read in the input and store the encoded string and \(K\).
2. Define the DP array \(dp\) where \(dp[i]\) represents the number of valid ways to decode the substring \(E[0..i-1]\).
3. Define arrays for storing the lexicographical order strings up to \(K\). Initialize it by scanning the encoded string \(E\) to update the DP values and collecting possible strings. Simply skipping `?` gives the lower bound which we use to fill.
4. Update the DP array: This involves iterating through each possible split to check the valid range (1-26), and for each split, recursively proceed to the end of the substrings, additions of the counts, and also collect lexicographically sorted strings. The numbers of decoded strings can be memoized to optimize using dynamic programming.

For DFS, we must use characters '0', '1', ..., '9' at each '.', but we can prune paths that lead to invalid sequences or those producing leading zeros. Pruning invalid path choices makes DFS more efficient.

*Base case returns 1 if valid decode found, 0 otherwise.*

Memoization:
For each `?` we replace and transition, store its count, loop over it to assign it all 10 numerics (0-9) and transition.
Calculate the number of possible valid decodings storing those sums and associated strings. A map stores indices and string for efficient retrieval.

To get the \(K\)th largest, we use a map to store counts of each string, then sort it to expose it. The \(K\)th element is extracted and processed.

*Recurrence*: Each valid combination builds on those that are valid. We store every combination count as we move.

*Depth-first search with pruning based on current characters and validity pool.*
*After computing results for all unread "?" fill in the blanks (akin to a map key-value store).*
*Format and output as requested, K-th largest being our final task.*

To solve the problem, use the approach of trying each possible assignment of digits to each `?` character. The goal is two-fold: achieving the maximum number of different decodings for a string and finding the \(K\)-th best among those strings lexicographically.

#### Implementation:
1. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Decodings:**  
With each `?`, calculate the number of decodings possible if filled with each valid digit from 0 to 9 ensuring the numbers formed are between 1 and 26.

2. **Lexicographic Order Identification:**  
We track strings that lead to the highest number of decodings and prioritize lexicographical ordering.

3. **Final Outputs:**  
After processing each case, return the \(K\)-th lexicographically smallest string capable of achieving the maximum decodings and the count.

Here's an approach implementing the above logic in C++:

    if (val > 26 || val < 1 || (val == 0 && i > 0) || dp[i] == -1)

There’s a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem:
1. Create a DP array, where `dp[i]` is the number of decodings ending at `i`. Initially, `dp[0] = 1` (empty string) and `dp[1] = 1` (single character).
  
2. Traverse the input string, starting from index 2:
- If the current character is not a question mark, only update dp[i] by dp[i-1] if current char is from 1 to 9, and possibly by dp[i-2] if the two preceding characters form a valid number (10 to 26).
  
- For question marks, if they form a valid number with upcoming digits, `dp[i]` could be updated by either dp[i-1] (for the first option) or dp[i-2] (if the number from the last two chars is valid).
  
3. Maintain two possible arrays using the same indexes to keep track of valid character sequences when filling in the question marks.

4. Collect these sequences and sort them. Then get the \(k\)th largest string and calculate the dp array to find the number of decodings.

5. Because the resulting number of decodings might be extremely large, remember to print the result modulo \(998244353\).

1. Compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the full length of $E$ (modulo $998,244,353$).
2. Main base cases are:
   - `""` = 1
   - `"?"` = 9 (represents 1, 2, ..., 9 digits as any leading 0 is invalid).
 
3. The core idea is that if a character is a digit, we branch:
   - take that digit, and recurse with the remaining string (subtracting the pre-count of steps for that digit)
   - if the next symbol is not `?` and we have sufficient characters, combine the next digit to form a 2-digit number. If valid (less than 27), we continue to recurse with the remaining string (subtracting the next digit's pre-count and 1 for the digit pair).

4. For the splitting logic, retain the index of "encouraged" splits as they give maximum leaf nodes.

5. The program builds and outputs a string for the \(K\)th largest possible reconstruction. The output must include the number of decoded strings modulo \(998,244,353\).

To solve this problem, we can take a dynamic programming approach by tracking the number of valid Morse sequence breaks for uncorrupted substrings up to length 3 of any string, while propagating back the number of valid Morse sequence extendable breaks another length.

To determine the uncorrupted string:

1. Initialize an array to help count valid possibilities via dynamic programming.
2. Use the DP approach to evaluate substrings and propagate limits.
3. The key step is to handle occurrences of `?` as either `1` through `9` excluding `1?`s which act like `0?` and to propagate how many ways 1 or 2 digit unlocks work.
4. Once evaluating up to `|E|`, if the string has `k` occurrences of `?`, analyze how many substrings with no `?` can be split optimally.
5. To find the \(K\)-th uncorrupted string, track the carry of occurrences that form `99`, `98`, `97`, ..., `11`. For each length of suffix of `?` you can pursue `k2`, with the next size `k1` determining a digit, summing to `10`.

Upon finishing the steps, the answer string can be constructed lexicographically. Since order is needed to find \(K\), this is a backwards-reconstruction process where:

- If ending in `1?`, use `19` if \(K = \text{possible for any} + 1\), else `18`.
- Otherwise, proceed from the highest override rule and the next lowest characters otherwise.

Here's a concise implementation of the solution:

To solve this problem, we need to account for the number of valid ways where a string can be parsed into a sequence of 1 or 2 digit numbers (between 1 and 26 inclusive). Denote this function as \(dp[i]\), which represents the number of ways to decode the string starting from index \(i\) to the end.

The base cases for \(dp\) are:
\[ dp[|E|] = 1 \]
\[ dp[|E|-1] = 1 \text{ if } E[|E|-1] \text{ is valid, else 0} \]

The recurrence relation is:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i+1] + dp[i+2] \text{ if } i+1 \text{ to } i+2 \text{ is a valid number} \]
\[ dp[i] = dp[i+1] \text{ if } i+1 \text{ is a valid number} \]

We build up the dp table from the end of the string towards the start. We handle the question marks (uncorrupted digits) by including every legal possibility in our computations for \(dp[i]\).

After pre-processing the string, we then convert it back into the \(K\)th largest lexicographical string with the highest number of decodings. This part involves backtracking from the \(end\) index using the \(dp\) table to generate valid strings.

The final step involves choosing the string that gives the maximum value for dp[0] and ensure it is given in the lexicographically \(K\)th highest valid string.

We must maximize the number of decode points, especially from `??` segments. 

1. For each contiguous sequence of `?`, we replace it as `12` for two-part sequences (`??`) and `1` for individual `?`. This ensures maximum decodes.
2. Using dynamic programming arrays dp[i] and dp2[i] (number of decodes ending from left and right, respectively), we compute the number of decodes.
3. For every maximal nums[i] at each position, add those nums[i] where the sequences end correctly.
4. With dp2[i] reversely counting decodes, we find out optimal decode strings.
5. Collect all optimal strings, sort, then output the Kth lexicographically largest one.

Starting with an encoded string $E$ with ? placeholders, we must uncorrupt each placeholder "?" by replacing with a non-zero digit so that the string can be partitioned into valid sequences of digits that decode into letters.

To solve this:
1. Handle "?" by replacing as `1` initially and calculate the maximum decodings from the appropriate recursive function.

2. Use a recursive function to count the number of ways a substring can be decoded, using an array `dp[N]` to keep the number of valid sequences.

3. Solve this with dynamic programming, considering two cases at each index:
   - The current digit by itself forms a valid number.
   - The current and next digit together form a valid number.

4. Calculate the sequences using previously computed values. If the previous decoded sequence is `i`, and it is possible to form another valid sequence with \(E[i+1]\) as the current starting, update the dp table according to the number of ways derived from it.

5. Handle the lexicographically order requirement by maintaining the order in our placeholder decoding.

The solution involves evaluating every segment for valid combinations and accumulating possibilities for each character position.

After determining the string(s) with the max decodings, the \( K^\)th largest one is located akin to a selection sort process over candidates.

Important considerations include checking the validity of encoding two sub-strings together \( s[i] + s[i+1] \) avoiding invalid values \((> 26)\), and handling edge cases like ending '0', which must stand alone, etc. Also, ensuring we process modulo \( 998, 244, 353 \) effectively without overflow.

We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode and to track the lexicographically K-th largest sequence of digits that can be achieved. For substrings ending at each index \(j\), define functions to record the max number of decodings, the last two characters, and the lexicographically greatest sequence producing maximum number of decodings.

Consider a DP array `c` where `c[j]` is the maximum number of decodings of the substring \(E\) from index \(0\) to \(j\). Recursion on `c[j]` can be based on what penultimate character we put in. Hence, there can be at most \(10\) choices for the previous number if the previous character is a digit.

Also maintain a DP mapping `d` which maps the count of decodings to every possible sequence of max decodings that correspond to this count (there is at most one such sequence, but there can be many ways to obtain this sequence). To keep only the K-th lexicographic, eliminate suffixes with fewer digits.

We explore all substrings using a prefix search which helps find the K-largest sequences efficiently. We iterate the entire string treating every digit/trailing two-digit substring as the potential penultimate.

<paraphrased>
Given a corrupted encoded string \(E\) with digits and question marks, tasks require finding the lexicographically Kth largest uncorrupted string. This uncorrupted string should result in the maximum possible number of decoded strings. All possible decoded strings should be determined, and the output should follow a specific format.
</paraphrased>

#### Observations

- The problem involves deciphering encoded strings and understanding all possibilities.
- Two approaches should be considered to achieve maximum decoded strings:
  1. Single-digit coding (e.g., 13)
  2. Two-digit coding (e.g., 135)

- The result must be calculated after replacing each '?' with a digit from 0 to 9 and evaluating possible decodings.
- With each position in the string \(E\), there are two options for decoding:
  1. Join it to the next digit
  2. Split it into 1 and the next digit
- Question marks should be iteratively replaced to reach the desired sequence.
- To determine the number of decodings, use dynamic programming (DP) with Modulo operations.

# Approach
To address the problem, follow these steps:

1. Replace each '?' with every digit from '0' to '9' iteratively.
2. Split the string based on the following criteria:
  - A single character always forms a single number.
  - Two consecutive characters form a single number if less than or equal to \(26\), and two numbers otherwise.
3. Implement dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways to form each possible encoded string.
4. Using dynamic programming, compute the possible number of decodings for the uncorrupted encoded string.

This approach involves careful string manipulation, dynamic programming, and parsing to achieve the required deciphering and maximization of decode counts.

Given a string \( E \) of \( N \) characters containing digits and question marks, we can use \(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\) dynamic programming with memoization to solve it.

### States and Transitions:
- Let \( E[i:j] \) denote the substring \( E \) from index \( i \) to index \( j \).
- We define \( \text{count}(E[i:j]) \) as the number of ways to decode \( E[i:j] \), maintaining the invariant that we only consider suffixes that can be split into substrings that map to a number between 1 and 26.
- Using memoization, we can precompute and store the results for each possible \( E[i:j] \).

### Precomputation of Factors:
Along with \( \text{count} \), we maintain an array `factors` such that:
- `factors[i] = (f1, f2)` where `E[i:j]` can be split in a valid way as the integer after splitting `E[i:j]` into a prefix `E[i:i+f1]` and suffix `E[i+f1:i+f1+f2]`.

### Base Case:
- For single-digit substrings `E[i:i+1]` where \( E[i:i+1] \neq 0 \):
    - If \( E[i:i+1] \) is a digit between 1 and 9, it can be split in two valid ways: by itself or as a prefix with a one-digit suffix.
    - If it's a `?`:
        - It can split \( 1 + f \), where `f` is all valid ways to consider `char(E[i+1:i+2])`.
    - If it's '0', invalid as single-digit.

### Complete Transition:
We compute \( \text{count}(E[i:j]) \) based both on \( \text{count}(E[i+1:j]) \) and \( \text{count}(E[i+1:j-2]) \):

- Variety \( 1 \) digit splitting disregarding factor \( E[i] \) with \( digits + factors \).
- Variety \( 2 \) is using factor splitting.

### Optimizations:
- Breaking a substring `abc...efgh` at position \( n \), we obtain two smaller substrings `abc...f` and `gh`. Ensure all possible splits starting at various offsets.

### Implementation
Consider building up `count(dp, i, j)`, storing in a dynamically managed memoization table.

To maximize the number of decodings for an uncorrupted string and efficiently find this maximum, dynamic programming (DP) is employed. The approach is based on states where each state represents a point in the string and the number of ways to reach that point considering all valid substrings of length between 1 and 2 that are valid (i.e., lie between 1 to 26). For binary search optimization, a prefix sum array maintains sums of DP tables, simplifying the counting of possible decodings up to a certain index. For each test case:
1. Clear global variables and handle corner cases, such as all `?` queries.
2. Use DP to calculate the number of ways to decode the string, incrementing an array count if the substring is valid and keeping track of binary search bounds accordingly. 
3. Evaluate the binary search bounds via the prefix_sum array.
4. After obtaining the maximum number of decodings, use a BFS to find the \(K\)th lexicographically largest uncorrupted string.
5. The BFS maintains a queue, increments/decrements the strings, and evaluates states until the \(K\)th uncorrupted string is found.

We leverage a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible uncorrupted strings that can be decoded into the maximum possible number of meaningful strings. Using DP with state calculations based on single or double-character splits helps us handle '?'. If a character is a '?', it could correspond to any digit (1-9), potentially creating multiple segments that overlap or not in the decoded string.

For each segment in the result, it will be one or two characters long but valid only if its numeric value is within the defined range (1-26). We loop through all possible segments and calculate the number of ways to form valid strings. After identifying the segments that maximize the number of possible decoded strings, the lexicographically K-th largest is determined via sorting and choosing appropriately from all possible uncorrupted strings that hit the maximum.

We then aim to identify the $K$-th largest uncorrupted string that achieves the maximum decoding count modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

To each question mark in $E$, we'll attempt to substitute every digit from $0$ to $9$. For every substituted string, we count the number of ways it can be properly decoded by considering every possible way to split the string such that each segment corresponds to a valid letter code.

Unlike the given sample format, the output should include the string with the maximum decoding count.

# Observations
<observation>Each possible value of a question mark needs to be considered in each substring being evaluated.</observation>
<observation>The length of $E$ can be up to $100{,}000$, making $O(\binom{n}{2} log n)$ impractical and necessitating a more efficient approach.</observation>
<observation>Duplicated numbers are not counted.</observation>
<observation>To handle duplicates in $K$, you must use a deque (`std::deque`) and erase duplicates.</observation>
<observation>Ensure no leading zeros.</observation>
<observation>Utilize a hashmap/dictionary to record the number of decodes for an encoded string.</observation>
<observation>For each string, consider all ways to split into valid letters:</observation>
- Splitting at a position: two parts formed at either side. The part on the right overrules the split position on the left.
- Run a 2D DP encoding value for ranges that determine maximum decodes in 1D.
- Iterate further right and start filtering decodes by length, for every valid length combinations.


# Algorithm
<par>
The objective is to:
<step>
Convert $E$ to all possible uncorrupted strings.
</step>
<step>
Generate all valid ways of dividing the string such that each substring maps to a valid letter.
</step>
<step>
Employ a map to track number of decodes for each potential string.
</step>
<step>
Repeat this process considering all possible replacements for each question mark position.
</step>
<step>
Maximize the number of decodes.
</step>
<step>
Filter results based on $K$ argument for maximum decode count.
</step>
</par>

# Implementation Approach

<par>
Let's break down the implementation details:
<step>Tackle empty strings or needing only a couple replacements.</step>
<step>Expand all possible replacements for question marks in $E$.</step>
<step>Count all possible decodings, storing intermediate results.</step>
<step>Filter outcomes by splitting logic.</step>
<step>Organize results, refine and output based on $K$.</step>
</par>

The primary bottleneck is generating all valid ways for the string to be split. This can be achieved recursively or with dynamic programming.

The task involves receiving an encoded string with possible question marks representing unknown digits. We must uncorrupt the string and divide it into numbers between 1 and 26, maximizing the number of distinct decoded strings. Multiple uncorrupted strings may reach this maximum. Our goal is to identify the \(K\)th lexicographically largest among these strings, along with the count of decoded strings it can produce. The exact number of decodings must be provided modulo \(998,244,353\).

* \(K \leq 1,000,000\): looking for the K-th lexicographical result, which is to be considered within a large but feasible limit.
* All characters of E are digits or question marks.
* K is never larger than the most uncorrupted string count.

To solve this problem:

1. **Count the occurrences of question marks** in the input string \(E\).
2. **Handle leading zero scenarios** and prioritize placing a '1' instead of a '2' immediately after a valid numeral.
3. **Replace '?' from the left with maximal possibilities**, ensuring to generate multiple valid encoded strings whenever possible.
    - Use recursion to establish the maximum number of ways.
4. For outputting, **sort all possible valid strings by lexicographical ordering**.

Conceptually, each segment between `?` or `1-9` belongs to a calculation of its decodable possibilities from dynamic programming where each substring can be parsed as a single or double-character code. If an uncorrupted version of the string contains a substring which can't map back to any integer in `[1,26]`, this way of uncorruption doesn’t work. Thus, need to try all possibilities.\(998,244,353\) modulus is applied to result.

The solution involves enumerating all possibilities, but is optimized by stopping and keeping track of the lexicographically top \(K\) valid uncorrupted strings.

### Approach:
Utilize dynamic programming and combinatorial counting to ascertain the possible splits and count the number of ways an uncorrupted string can be decoded. For all possible strings with the maximum decodability, track them lexicographically. To facilitate computations efficiently, set limits and constraints, especially the modulo operation for large counts.

# Pseudocode:
1. Preprocess input; for each test case:
    - Parse string \(E\) and integer \(K\).
2. Define a DP table `dp[i]` representing the number of ways to decode the substring starting from position `i`.
3. Compute values in reverse through string \(E\), treating pairs of digits appropriately and ensuring they remain within the valid range (1 to 26).
4. For `?` positions, compute for every valid digit substitution the adjusted dp values.
5. Track the string(s) with the highest dp value, handling ties via lexicographic order.
6. Use counting modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to compactly report results.
7. Return \(K\)th lexicographically largest string among the maxima and its count.

Let \( dp[i] \) represent the number of valid ways to decode \( s[i:] \) and \( parent[i] \) the next valid character position \( j \) after decoding s[i]. We precalculate \( dp \) and \( parent \) using tabulation. 

We then use a priority queue to store candidates; candidate at index \( i \) is ordered by decreasing number of valid decoded strings. The sorting occurs in reverse lexicographical order because \( (i, n) \) compares less than \( (j, m) \) if i > j or i = j and n < m.

For a candidate at position \( i \) in the priority queue, we have the current character in buffer \( s[i..sum] \). At each step, we track the number of ways to split and decode in \( ways \). The final condition is to ensure all characters appear until the \((len-1)\)th position to form valid decodings.

The exact steps to compute and extract the \( K \)-th largest candidate are as follows:

**Initialize DP Table**:
1. Compute \( dp \) and \( parent \) in reverse, evaluating for valid encodings of the numbers 1 to 26.
2. For each prefix that decodes uniquely, update \( dp \) and \( parent \) with a split at the prefix’s end.
3. For a "?", it can be replaced one of 10 ways. Hence traverse all replacements and compute their DP values.

**Find Klargest candidate**:
1. Use a priority queue to store prefixes; if the prefix’s last character matches the next start index pointing, the next occurrence, if any, is consequent.
2. Priority comparison ensures the lexicographically smaller prefix is invalidated first.
3. When the heap size overflows, invalidate the largest entry and shrink the heap.
4. Repeat the process until the \( K \)-th smallest prefix.

The following code accomplishes the required in an optimized manner:

To keenly solve this problem:
- Utilize dynamic programming to efficiently merge options:
- `dp[s][k]` is the sum of ways to decode strings from \(s\) with \(k\) or fewer valid decode strings.
- Additionally, track a list `top[s][k]` with the maximum options up to this \(k\) that lead to `dp[s][k]`.
- For each segment beyond the first, ascertain if it forms `XX` fewer than `26`, otherwise treat it as `X`.
- Merge options respecting leading zeros consistently. For instance, "1?" should be recognized as `10` and `1x`.
- After encoding strings and computing `dp` and `top`, track the \(K\)th-largest binary split with maximum decode counts under a `K`-way option.
- To find the desired string, reconstruct the `K`th-largest string from valid splits ensuring maximum decode counts.

## Explanation
We need to figure out how to uncorrupt an encoded string \(E\) (which is only composed of digits and question marks) to maximize the number of possible decodings.

Each segment of digits can form multiple valid substrings, and computing all segments' values comes down to considering segments of lengths 1 or 2 (since we can take up to two digits at a time). Additionally, whenever question marks appear in the segment, they can be 0-9, which multiplies the number of possible results.

### Steps to Solve
1. **Replace Question Marks in All Possible Ways:**
   - Each question mark can be replaced by a digit 0-9.
   - Note: Use a bitmask to iterate over all possible ways to assign digits to question marks.
   
2. **Count Possible Decodings Using DP and Fibonacci:**
   - Use dynamic programming on the string to build the Fibonacci sequence, where a Fibonacci sequence value represents the number of ways to decode certain segments.
   
3. **Identify Lexicographically \(K\)th Largest String:**
   - Use a priority queue to maintain all possible valid strings sorted lexicographically.
   
4. **Preferences for Correctness and Efficiency:**
   - Prefer choosing smaller digits to maximize lexicographical invalids when multiple options have the same Fibonacci value and all decodings are used.
   
5. **Output the Result:**
   - Ensure the number of decodings is taken modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

const int MOD = 998244353;
vector<long long> dp; // Fibonacci numbers
vector<int> base; // `K` largest possible values

// Calculate the number of decodings for a given string
long long fill(string s) {
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= (int)s.size(); i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * 10 % MOD;
        if (i > 1) dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
        dp[i] %= MOD;
    }
    return dp[(int)s.size()];
}

// Find a valid string (minimizing lexicographically) that loses the given smallest value
string lose(string s, long long lost) {
    while (!base.empty() && lost >= base.back()) {
        lost -= base.back();
        base.pop_back();
    }
    string res = s;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
        if (lost >= dp[s.size() - i - 1]) {
            if (s[i] == '?') s[i] = '0';
            res = min(res, s + string(i + 1, '0'));
            lost -= dp[s.size() - i - 1];
        }
    }
    return res;
}

Rewriting the problem: This question is asking us to solve two parts.

If a digit sequence in \(E\) is \$X29\$, we would split it into solo digits. Conversely, \$X10\$ will be left as \$X10\$, forming the key segmentation strategy.
</observation>
<observation>
If \(E\) is not corrupt, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode the string. But for the corrupt version, we need a recursion that handles the `?`s.
</observation>
<observation>
For a given string, the number of ways to decode it is a sum of the ways to decode substrings: `numWays(E[i:]) = numWays(E[i:j]) * numWays(E[j:])` where `j-i` is either 1 or 2 (valid substrings are lengths 1 to 2). 
</observation>
<observation>
Thus, to maximize the number of decodings, we want to ensure that as many substrings as possible are of length 2.
</observation>
<observation>
If a question mark can split the string validly (i.e., for a substring like `1?0`, `1` and `0` can be separated), we should force it to do so to achieve maximum decode counts.
</observation>
<observation>
To find the $K$-th uncorrupted sequence, we generate all possible valid sequences and sort them, and then extract the $K$-th.
</observation>
<observation>
Finally, we can compute the decode counts as before, but for the corrupted case, we add an extra recursive path for questions that can force splits.

### Solution Plan:
1. Parse the input and generate all valid replacements for the corrupted string (\(`?`).
2. Use a recursive function to calculate the number of ways to decode a cleaned-up sequence with memoization.
3. For each cleaned-up sequence, calculate the number of decode ways and sort these sequences to get the $K$-th sequence.
4. To maximize decode counts, avoid introducing leading zeros unless necessary.

---

To solve this problem, we are going to rely heavily on dynamic programming (DP) and DP with memoization within a simulated DFS approach for handling the splits. Below is an approach to segmentation of encoded strings based on invariant counts of splits/valid-strings, and exploiting DFS for valid splits to maximize decode count.

Step-by-step process:
- Initialize a DP array where `DP[i]` represents the maximum number of valid decodings that can be achieved from position `i` onwards.
- For recursion and DFS, use a generator of potential splits to avoid list indexing ahead of time.
- Utilize a memoized DFS function to explore all valid splits from some digit and backtrack those that aren't promising (given size constraints in leading zeroes).
- Keep track of how many question marks are unexplored to assign remaining digits efficiently.
- Once the DFS unravel, we can count the number of valid encode ways, for each segment, based on DP results, and compute the final modulo value.
- For the final step, we use a generated complete dictionary of valid encoded strings with their decode counts, ranked lexicographically and selected by K.

# Algorithm
Overall, the algorithm is:
1. Parse input to validate leading digits and prepare for counting via `?` guesses as one possible character.
2. Initialize a DP array where each element `DP[i]` starting from index `i` into possible segment boundaries moving right.
3. Populate the DP array through DFS combined with memoization examining all possible characters that `?` positions can take.
4. Having computed the maximum counts, do DFS over the valid dictionary evaluating, and sorting lexicographically each case using the finalized decode counts.
5. Output the \(K\)-th largest cleaned string and the associated count of decode paths.

# Implementation

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;

// Stores number of ways each possible split can be uncorrupted.

For this task, we require a combination of string processing and dynamic programming to determine possible decodings while taking into account all valid and invalid transitions. We also incorporate combinatorics and factorial counts to assess the number of valid splits possible for each uncorrupted string.

The following code describes the implementation of this concept:
- Replace '?' with '0'.
- Generate all combinations of '?' replacements
- For each combination, evaluate all possible splits while recording their counts.
- Compute possible splits using dynamic programming by counting valid digits from `1` to `26`.
- Use the factorial of the number of splits to index buckets and accumulate values.
- Sort by the number of splits in descending order and then lexicographically within the same key group.
- Return the Kth largest string and its associated factorial-based bucket value.

The input consists of a corrupted encoded string \(E\) with some digits or question marks, and a number \(K\). The task is to clean the corruption (replace question marks with digits) for the largest possible number of interpretations of \(E\) into sequences of valid character codes 1-26. Multiple such options are chosen based on lexographical order. The output should provide the Kth largest uncorrupted version of \(E\) and the count of valid interpretations under modulo 998,244,353.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode the string for various choices of uncorrupting question marks. We'll maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to decode the first \(i\) characters of the encoded string such that the last character is `j` (or has a certain leading digit if `j > 9`). Additionally, we need to ensure that no leading zeros are introduced.

A key observation here is that a question mark can be replaced by any digit (0-9), but in order to maximize the number of possible interpretations, it's only beneficial to replace '?' only by digits 1 through 26. This means we should always handle pairs of consecutive digits together if they are not already part of a previously decoded segment.

Once we calculate the DP table, the maximum number of ways to decode the string can be determined. Then, to find the \(K\)th largest string, a combination of DFS for exploration and a stack for tracking lexicographically sorted results can be employed.

We also need to handle cases like leading zeros separately to ensure they do not affect our counts.

Dynamic programming using memoization makes the decoding process efficient. We can leverage prefix sums to quickly calculate the total number of ways to decode the string up to a certain point, which helps in validating our string replacements.

To solve the problem, we'll break down the solution into steps:

1. Understand the structure of possible decodings:
    - Digits form ranges 1 through 26.
    - Locations like `122` (3 characters) could be `1 2 2`, `12 2`, `1 22`.
    - Question marks allow multiple valid substitutions, expanding possibilities.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach for Subproblem Counting:
    - Compute a DP subproblem in \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) that counts the number of ways to decode substrings if they start with a digit \(d\).
    - We treat `?` as a variable and try replacing it with all possible digits from 0 to 9:
        - After replacement, split the string into `digit1 digit2` and use DP to compute its counts recursively.
        - When `?` is at the beginning, substitute it with `1` or `2`, splitting into `1xxx` or `2xxx`.

3. Prepare the Loop Variable:
    - Create a loop variable to iterate over the number of `?`s.
    - Prepare the string and initialize the loop counter over the number of uncorrupted forms (considering lexicographic order).

4. Find the Lexicographically \(K\)th Largest Form:
    - Among the strings with the maximum number of decoded strings, find the \(K\)th largest.

Our task is to recover a string of digits and count the maximum number of ways to split this into valid Morse characters, which are between 1 and 26.

* Firstly, we will process the string from the back. This allows us to use previous cached results to simply calculate further results, both for the readonly function that gives the number of valid splits, and the dp function that determines the best "?" recovery.

* To calculate the reconstruction and splitting state of a segment $E[l, r]$, we consider the segment having up to one "?" at the end. This leads to the state recovery function $states(l, r)$, giving the maximum splits without extra "?" and the position of "?" if one is needed.

1. Having decided where the "?", if any, is, we calculate the number of states resulting from different splits. For this, we iterate over the left end $i$ of a split resulting from more splits to the right. The middle it ends at is $j$ (starting after the previous split or "?" if at the leftover) and the fragment "1" or "2" we cut off is at $q$.

* The function `dp(l, r)` does just this, calculating the maximum number of states for a substring and its recovered "?" character if any. We do this by starting from an end "$?"$ and using recurrence on all previous ending splits and "?"s: `dp(l, r, er)` becomes `dp(l, r, er+1)` after recovering an `?` as `1` or `2`.

2. This function allows us to iteratively compute the number of states and "?" position for all $E[i, r]$ and $E[l, E.length - 1]$ for $dp(l, r, er+1)$.

3. From all such possible splitting results, we choose the one leading to the most states and retain the recovering "?" we used to get it. This also gives us $e[l, r]$, the position of the "?" doing the splitting or not doing any if not needed.

* Finally, once complete, we have a tree of states endpoints and substitutions "?", going back to the start and recovering the string. We traverse it to recover the $K$th largest string amongst those with the most states, by keeping track of the letter formed by the split.

* If no "?" is required, necessarily $K = 1$. We output this string and the number of states for it modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

The solution to this problem involves both dynamic programming (DP) and backtracking. Let’s break down the steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Remove all spaces from the input string and handle the base cases.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**: Create a DP table, where `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to decode the substring starting from index `i` to the end.
3. **Helper Function**: Define a helper function that uses backtracking to calculate `dp[i]` considering two character combinations where possible.
4. **String Generation**: For every valid position in the input string, generate all possible uncorrupted strings by recursively substituting `?` with digits. 
5. **Multiset & Optimization**: Store all possible string decodings in a multiset for lexicographic sorting and selection of the Kth one.
6. **Compute Result and Modulo**: Finally, compute the output by selecting the \( K \)-th largest result and the number of total decodings modulo 998244353.

To solve each test case:

- Determine the maximal number of decode strings: This is the usual Fibonacci sequence \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\) for every `?` which can join with its next digit, counting recursively. Do a DFS or DP to compute as many of those splits as possible, taking care to avoid creating invalid leading zeros.

- Enumerate the K-th best uncorrupted string with that many decode strings from every string with that count of decode strings. Prefer two-digit (`?X` or `X?`) splits if they don't produce leading zeros. 

- Given the Fibonacci nature of this, using modular arithmetic on \(998244353\) will simplify numeric values.

- For the DFS we aim to place `?`s individually. At each node, we check the two possible placements for `?` if spaces are available: one-digit (`?`) and two-digit (`XX?` or `X?X` or `?XX`). If there are multiple such placements, we prefer `X?X`, because it maintains leading zeros properly and leads to valid splits around the pre-existing pattern.

# Possible Approach
We traverse the encoded string with a DFS and process each segment based on its possible splits. For a given segment, if there’s a `?` in it, we try replacing it with each digit `0-9` and then splitting it optimally to maximize the number of ways we can decode the string ending in this segment, ensuring there’s no leading zero.

To achieve the required `K`-th lexicographically smallest encoded string, for each `?` with digits `0-9`, we generate updated versions of the encoded string, sort them lexicographically, and determine which is the `K`-th smallest.

# Implementation
Below is an example for simulating the DFS with Fibonacci-style dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

const long long MOD = 998244353;

            if (i > 1) cache[i] = (cache[i] + cache[i - 2]) % MOD;
            else cache[i] = (cache[i] + 1) % MOD;

The key to solving is to find the maximum number of decoding strings for an uncorrupted string and find the kth lexicographically largest string. For this, we shall perform calculations for each possible uncorrupted string. This involves converting all possible combinations of question marks to decimal digits and checking all possible decodings for that string.

We can do this through dynamic programming combined with lexicographic generation techniques, ensuring the solution is optimal and within the constraint limits.

We receive an encoded string, $E$, potentially containing `?` symbols. The task is to uncorrupt this string by substituting every `?` with a valid digit from `0` to `9` and subsequently splitting the resultant version into digit sequences where each sequence falls within $1$ to $26$. The objective is to identify the corrected string that yields the maximum count of unique decodings, among which we return the \(K\)th lexicographically greatest.

You are given an encoded string E that may contain question marks. Replace each question mark with a digit to create an uncorrupted encoded string.

Since the input consists of numbers from 1 to 26, a valid encoded string can be derived from any string of characters \(A\) through \(Z\). So, we can compute the ways to decode any given valid encoded string.

Notice that strings are encoded by two rules:
- Single digits encode their 'A' to 'Z' equivalents.
- Two digit sequences, such as '11' or '26', encode characters from 'L' to 'Z'.

The largest possible number of decodings for a given encoded string \(E\) consists of combinations of single and two digits.

An uncorrupted string could encode the most by:
- Containing multiple uninterrupted sequences \(10\) to \(26\) so that inserting a digit \(1\) or \(2\) between sequences doubles the number of decodings. 
- Not ending in a pre-2 digit that won't form a valid 2-digit sequence (3-9 ending).
- Remaining possible digits could always append 1, if it forms a valid sequence, doubling the decodings further.

Given this, we can use dynamic programming to determine the maximal number of decodings \(NPC(x)\) for the substring \(E_x\):
\[ NPC(x) = PRI(x) + [(PRI(x-2) + (PARMBLS(x-3) * 2 \mod 998244353), \text{if VALID_ONE}(E_{x-2}, 1) \& \& (x-2 \geq 0)] \]
where 
- \(PRI(x)\) denotes the number of decodings for the substring \(E_1E_2 \ldots E_x\),
- \(PARMBLS(x)\) is the number of non-decodable prefixes.

An invalid prefix \(E_x\) is non-decodable if \(10 <= E_x <= 26\) for \(x \geq 1\).

We can then evaluate possible decodings from the modified ? to generate max decodings substrings and sort these. 

Finally, solve for K-th maximal encoding as required.

The task is to repair an encoded string with digits and `?`s and spaces removed, such that it maximizes the number of possible decoded strings. You must place each `?` with a digit from 0 to 9, ensuring each resulting number is between 1 and 26. Among the strings that can be decoded most ways, select the lexicographically largest \(K\)th one. Additionally, count the number of decodings, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We must replace `?` digits strategically in our string \(E\) in such a way that we maximize the number of valid decodings while fulfilling the condition of achieving lexicographically \(K\)th highest among these optimal ones. The string's length and number of `?` is up to \(100{,}000\).

### Key Insight
- Each substitution for a `?` should ensure the length of possible decodings is maximized.
- Lexicographically largest string is needed for resolving ties among optimal solutions.
- Dynamic Programming (DP) might be helpful in managing the decoding count, especially for longer strings.

### Steps
1. **Problem Breaking**:
    - Isolate segments between digits. Determine possible `?` placements that do not break the range (1-26).
2. **Counting Decodings (Dynamic Programming)**: 
    - Define a function \(f(i)\) as the number of ways to decode \(E[i…]\). 
    - Compute \(f\), maintaining optimal placements within specified ranges, taking care of substitutions.
3. **Decoding Maximizing**:
    - Explore all possible configurations for subsets of `?` to find maximizing configurations.
4. **Finding \(K\)th Optimal Configuration**: 
    - Use lexicographical ordering constraints to efficiently isolate desired optimal solution.
5. **Modulo Arithmetic**:
    - Apply modulo arithmetic \(998{,}244{,}353\) while combining the counts.

### Observations
- String manipulations and proper substitution for `?` will likely to use `O(L*iota)` space and operations.
- Ensure single-digit transitions do not alter the maximum count.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of valid decodings for each possible encoded string and then determine which of these strings has the maximum number of decodings. 

1. **Process Corrupted Encoded String:**
   - For each `?`, consider all possible digits \(0\) through \(9\).
   - For each valid string, calculate the number of valid decodings using dynamic programming similar to the classic problem of counting the number of distinct ways to decode a string.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Decodings:**
   - We maintain a DP table `count[i]` representing the number of ways to decode the substring \(E[0 \text{ to } i]\).
   - For each position `i`, if the substring \(E[i-1 \text{ to } i]\) or \(E[i-2 \text{ to } i]\) forms a valid encoded letter, we update the DP state accordingly.
   - We also need to handle the constraints that each valid digit must be between 1 and 26 (inclusive).

3. **Max Decoding Strings:**
   - Identify all possible uncorrupted strings that have the maximum number of decodings.
   - Sort these strings lexicographically and select the \(K\)-th largest among them.

4. **Efficient Implementation:**
   - Use a custom comparator to sort strings lexicographically in reverse order to get the largest string.
   - Use a division trick to handle large numbers modulo \(998244353\) efficiently during the sum computation.

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;
int K;

Given a string \( E \) with question marks and digits, we need to replace question marks with digits and split the uncorrupted string into valid sequences that decode to letters (where each number from \(1\) to \(26\) corresponds to a letter). The goal is to find the uncorrupted form of \( E \) that allows the maximum number of different decodings, and for such forms, we need to output the Kth lexicographically largest one along with the number of possible decodings.

### Constraints:
- All characters in \( E \) are either digits (0-9) or question marks (?).
- Maximum length of \( E \) is \(100{,}000\) across all test cases.
- Value of \( K \) is never more than the maximum possible number of different decodings of \( E \).

### Observations:
1. If multiple uncorrupted strings can be decoded into the maximum number of different strings, choose the lexically smallest options lexicographically.
2. A digit cannot be preceded by leading zeroes when decoding, meaning sequences like `02` are invalid.
3. To maximize the number of ways to decode, replace every question mark with either `1` or `2`, but ensuring no sequences start with `0`.
4. Iterate through the corrupted string \( E \), replacing each question mark with `1` or `2` to form different uncorrupted sequences.
5. Using DP with a state `dp[i][mask]` to count total sequences from \(E[i:length]\) with a mask representing valid split conditions.

This solution iteratively builds the answer using dynamic programming, with scoring and recursion-based solutions to handle conversions from corrupted to clean sequences and subsequent decodings. By ensuring we precompute and prioritize valid numbers, we optimize the search for decodings while handling unique K-th mappings efficiently.

Given an encoded string E with question marks, we aim to recreate a version of E with no question marks that optimizes the count of distinct possible decoded strings. Digits '0' to '9' are treated as encoded positions '1' to '26'.

E is uncorrupted by replacing each '?' with either '0' or '1-9'. Each segment formed by these digits must range from '1' to '26'. The number of possible strings obtained from E is calculated, considering '?', which can contribute to '11', '12',..., '29', or '00'. However, avoiding leads of '0'.

Next, sort all valid uncorrupted strings, interpreting '?' as all potential digits. Output the Kth string ensuring the maximum number of decoded strings and return the count of strings modulo 998244353.

The core to the solution involves generating all possible valid replacements for the question marks, while maximizing the count of the possible decodings for each candidate. Each replacement split adds complexity.

Here's an algorithm for the solution:

1. Define a recursive function `solve(i)` that returns a map from possible remaining length of the segment starting from index `i` to the count of ways this segment can be decoded. We only care about the lengths that remain valid numbers (between 1 and 26).
2. For each start i of the string:
   - If it's a question mark, try to fill it with each valid digit ('1', '2', ..., '9') or '0'. This way, for each '?' we generate multiple possibilities for decoding.
   - If it's a digit or cannot be ?, we only process it alone or in combination with the next digit to form a single valid number (between 10 and 26), carefully avoiding leading zeros.
   
We note that '?' can generate multiple solutions, which complicates the direct scanning for the K-th largest string solution.

The approach requires dynamic programming to calculate scores for patches of digits. For every patch of digits from position \(i\) to \(i + u\), store two values: one is the number of strings it can form, and the second is its rank among such strings when all others have maximum possible scores. We can combine the suitability counts of subproblems when reassembling the overall solution. To get mergable answers, we store DP counts as cumulative log sums. Doing this lets us see which callsites have a higher rank, giving some preference to subproblems where there was a smaller number of decoding ways to choose from.

The solution greatly benefits from memoization in Python, specifically the `lru_cache` decorator.

For uncorrupted strings like `12345` we have no question marks, and the answer is simply the number of ways to split this string into valid chunks, where each chunk is between length 1 and length 2.

Let `dp[s]` be the number of ways to decode the substring `E[s:]`. 

Let's consider the value `dp[i]`. If `E[i]` isn't a `'0'` or `'?'`, we can simply check each valid length - either decode `E[i]` individually or decode `E[i]` as part of a longer chunk. Then encode the result of this via multiplication.

If `E[i]` is `'?'`, then replacing it with 1 or 2 turns it into a valid digit, and to count our possibilities we just add up the ways to decode each suffix and concatenate with '1' and '2', respectively. This captures the maximum number of possible decodings.

At the end of building this DP table, we find all maximum possibilities and sort them lexically.

### Approach:
To solve the problem, determine the splits that produce the highest number of possible decodings, and then select the lexicographically $K$-th largest corresponding string among these. Enumerate splits, calculate possible decodings via DP using recurrence relations, while also storing current valid strings.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Pre-process input string, replacing any leading zeros, identifying valid splits.
2. Run dynamic programming via a DP mechanism that tracks splits and respective decodings.
3. For every split, build a string from the string $E$ based on splits.
4. Construct all valid strings, sort them lexicographically, and select the $K$-th one.
5. Return optimal configuration for DP state that gives the maximum decoding count.

`?` can be any single valid digit (1-9) or part of a valid two-digit number (10-26). Let’s split the string carefully into valid sections:

1. Start with the string and process from the left. Process string segments to find the optimal spot to split, taking into account the next set of digits.
2. Store the best possible solutions while avoiding invalid splits (like `05`, `07`, but `10` is allowed). 
3. Consider the leading digit first if `?` is the start of a two-digit number, as leading zeros are not valid.
4. If valid, take both digits as a potential split at `?` (like `1?` being `11` to `19`). Else, consider single digit endings.
5. Use dynamic programming to remember the state at each split and compute the counts of valid splits.
6. Track the required \( K \) top uncorrupted versions that achieve this. Sort them lexicographically.
7. Calculate and output the result for each test case modulo 998,244,353.

Example implementation:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll MOD = 998244353;

// Get the number of ways to decode a string
ll dp[100001];
bool vis[100001];
ll num_ways(const string &s, ll pos) {
    if (pos == (ll)s.size())
        return 1;
    if (vis[pos])
        return dp[pos];
    vis[pos] = true;
    dp[pos] = (s[pos] >= '1' && s[pos] <= '9') ? num_ways(s, pos + 1) : 0;
    if (pos < (ll)s.size() - 1 && s[pos] != '0' && stoi(s.substr(pos, 2)) <= 26)
        dp[pos] = (dp[pos] + num_ways(s, pos + 2)) % MOD;
    return dp[pos];
}

// Helper function to extract the n-th lexicographically largest uncorrupted string
void solve(const string &s, int n, string &res) {
    res = s;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '?') {
            // Figure out ways to fill this ?
            for (char ch = (res[i - 1] == '0' ? '1' : '0'); ch <= '9'; ++ch) {
                if (i > 0 && res[i - 1] == '?' && ch > '1')
                    break;
                if (i + 1 < (int)res.size() && res[i + 1] >= '0' && res[i + 1] <= '6')
                    ++ch;
                res[i] = ch;
                if (num_ways(res, 0) >= n) {
                    return;

You receive a corrupted encoded string containing digits and question marks. Your task is to uncorrupt the string by replacing each question mark with a digit. The uncorrupted string must be split into a sequence of numbers between 1 and 26 inclusive. The goal is to find the uncorrupted string that can be decoded into the maximum number of valid sequences of letters.

In cases where multiple uncorrupted strings achieve the maximum number of decoded strings, output the lexicographically Kth largest among them and the maximum number of decoded strings modulo \(998,244,353\).

- \(1 \leq K \leq 1{,}000{,}000\): \(K\) can be large; bit masking may not be feasible
- Sum of \(|E|\): Total string length across all test cases is bounded, so can handle substring DP, but large \(K\) means we need to be careful about large states.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Constructing Substrings**: For any substring from \( i \) to \( j \) inclusive, determine if the substring formed by replacing all question marks into digits is valid (contained in `1-26`).
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: Initialize a DP table similar to COUNT from CODEJAM's PATHCOUNT problem, where `dp[i]` will denote the number of ways to decode the first \( i \) characters.
3. **Handling '?' in the String**: For any character `?`, we will try using both `1` and `9`.
4. **Two Pointers and Memoization**: For the goal to maximize the number of decode strings, we carefully use memoization for the sub-problem. If E[i] = `?`, try splitting E[:i], E[i:i+1], and E[:i+1], and continue incrementing with `1` or `9`. Carry over results between valid split cases.
5. **Track Top-K Results**: While filling in the DP table, also keep track of the top K options with the maximum number of splits and maintain their lexicographically largest string, maintaining the earliest ones (smallest indices).
6. **Converting Indices to Strings**: After DP table is filled, convert the selected indices back to their respective lexicographical forms, update, and output.

The problem presents a string \(E\) of digits and question marks. Each question mark can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9.

Below is the full implementation:

Key observations and ideas:
1. Use DP to calculate the maximal number of unique decodings of any prefix of \(E\).
2. When a substring corresponds to `1` or `21` to `26`, use combinations modulo \(998,244,353\) to count strings.
3. For each position, we look \(1\), \(2\) or no segments ahead to maximize, ensuring leading zeros are valid.
4. After preprocessing, search for the \(K\)th ranked substring preferring \(1\) over leading zeros in ties.
5. Finally, correct padding and output the corresponding decoded strings.

<observations>

Each potentially decoded string must contain only letters A to Z. Since `1A`, `11`, `11A` and `111` are all inadequate, efficient regex or string-checking logic is required. 
To understand the outcomes, a dynamic programming (DP) approach would help, where states represent the current position and the number of final substrings. 
Substitutions for `?` should be made to ensure maximum decodings. Use `re` functionalities to determine all feasible decodings for each string candidate and `itertools` or `math` to find permutations.

We will use dynamic programming and backtracking to find all possible coded strings from each uncorrupted string candidate. The solution involves determining the maximum number of decoded strings a candidate can generate:
1. When a `?` arises, substitute it with digts `0` through `9`, preferring smaller digits to choose the lexicographically smaller/correct string.
2. Use a dynamic programming matrix to track each combination of steps to a valid or invalid state.
3. Identify all strings within \$[1, 26]\$, and for each substring, update the valid decode count.
4. Backtracking will allow finding the lexicographically $K$th-largest string along with the maximum decode number.

For each uncorrupted string, the task is essentially to compute how many ways the uncorrupted string can be split such that every part represents a valid letter, i.e., between `1` and `26`. We use dynamic programming to compute these counts efficiently. Given a string, we iterate over it and use a DP array, `dp[i]`, which stores the number of ways to decode the string ending at that position. 

However, crucially, we are looking for an uncorrupted string with the maximal number of valid decodings. Therefore, we aim to replace each `?` in the original string with the maximum number of valid ways of translating to a valid split inside a DFS function. When we encounter a `?`, we try each possibility, from `1` to `9`, and track the number of possible ways we can decode the string ending at that index.

The lexicographical order to get the largest string is considered by comparing lexicographically every slight change in uncorrupted strings. We also use `dp` array to count valid decodings, which carries forward the possibility count to each step by recursively checking each position.

Finally, we back-track to get the largest string by fixing the $K$th position amongst all strings after all recursions. Keeping everything within modulus \(998{,}244{,}353\) handles large numbers effectively.

We solve this problem via two dynamic programming (DP) passes.

1. **Generation of Uncorrupted Strings:** We compute a DP table `G[i][mask]` which is how many filled entries exist that replace a prefix with a particular bit mask indicating which digits are already replaced by `?`. The states get combined appropriately as a function of which digit we replace next and which digits are unconstrained.

2. **Decoding of Uncorrupted Strings:** Using another DP, we check which values of `G[i][mask]` can produce the lexicographically $K$th largest uncorrupted string. We only continue if the count is greater, or the count is equal but the string is lexicographically bigger. We leverage a map, `A`, to ensure high DP counts are prioritized. The map stores all strings that share a DP count. An early break speed-up is used when `A` contains a string size greater than or equal to the desired $K$.

# Implementation

We start by evaluating all possible ways to uncorrupt a string, analyzing how to split it into valid groups [1,26]. We maintain a set (or efficient collection) of viable uncorrupted strings, favoring fewer question marks or lexicographically smaller options in ties. This allows for maximizing decoded strings' count. Result evaluation applies modular arithmetic for large outputs. We ensure efficient handling of modified strings and multiple test cases.

The problem requires generating all possible valid numeric sequences from the input string $E$ containing digits and question marks, with question marks can be replaced by any digit.

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming but in a reverse manner: start with a blank slate and generate all possible number of decoded strings. Here, the state will represent the count of possible decodings for a string of length n up to character i. 

To efficiently solve for the largest lexicographically uncorrupted string, we need to account for splitting strings when characters in the string allow two different splits, like `??2` can be `282` or `21`, and get the correct decoding counts for both then check which to place in the result string.

Additionally, to quickly find the K-th largest we can use the combination with binary search to find the K-th possible misspelling and form that string, all using a DFS with memoization to achieve a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(len(E))^2\).

We aim to maximize the count of decodable strings after uncorrupting the encoded string $E$, while ensuring no multiplication crosses the 26 bound. A valid strategy is to ensure no leading zeros and utilize question marks directly. We apply Fibonacci sequence and modular arithmetic to calculate possible counts of valid decodability. 
```
Output Computation:  

Read T, the number of test cases.
for each test case,
- Read the string E and the integer K.
- Initialize the answer to a string all `0`s of the same length.
- Initialize a DP table with zeros, starting with dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, and dp[2] = 2, to manage counts.
- For each character and index `i` of E:
  - Drop the answer character at `i` if it's '0'.
  - If E(`i`) is '`?`', drop the answer at `i` a character and add "910" at the same position to update all possible maximum counts with valid encodings.
  - If E(`i`) is between '1' and '2', set the answer at `i` to that digit and set possible counts.
  - If E(`i`) is '0', set the answer at `i` to '0' and only proceed if the current answer is lexicographically `K`th largest.
  - Update the DP table according to the decoded values between 1 and 26.
- Print the answer and the DP value for the size of the string Modulo 998244353.

The first step in solving this problem involves converting '?' characters into each digit from 0 to 9 to explore possible strings. Depending on the substring length, we can determine valid splits and calculate the number of possible decodings for each configuration.

We maintain a dp-state representing the maximum possible number of decodings for a substring \( E[i...j] \). We initialize the state values for uncorrupted digits and then propagate for question marks and valid strings, ensuring values fall within the specified bounds.

To find the lexicographically K-th largest valid string, we can generate valid sequences and sort them. However, for efficiency, we can use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the top-K valid strings. We can push each uncorrupted string and its corresponding count of valid decodings into the heap. After processing, we retrieve and print the required string or count from the heap.

# Recursive approach
Define a function `paths(s, k)` that counts valid decoded sequences from string `s` up to `k` characters, and `find_answer(s, k)` that outputs the \( k \)-th lexicographical uncorrupted string.

A `solve(i)` function to recursively explore all possible values for each `?` in `s`. Each valid split is added to a list of solutions. 

The list of solutions are then sorted to find the \( k \)-th lex element.

First, calculate for each possible value of \(i\) the number of decodings that would occur if the uncorrupted string had no question marks and its length was \(i\). This is a Fibonacci sequence essentially because if the last character represents a single digit, it would be the ways \(i-1\) long could be decoded; if the last two digits are under 27, it could represent a two-digit group and thus the ways \(i-2\) could be decoded. 

The string can naturally be broken into segments separated by question marks. For segments with consecutive question marks, treat them as a single parameter, and calculate the decodings for every possible replacement; storing and combining these in a dynamic programming table \(dp[i]\) which counts the number of ways to decode the string up to index \(i\).

To get the maximum ways of decoding for the string, maximize through an array while keeping track of all strings giving this maximum number of decodings. Keep a list of good uncorrupted strings, then sort it lexicographically, and return the \(k\)th string, also printing the maximum decoding count modulo \(998244353\).

The task potentially involves generating all combinations when replacing `?` with digits (between 0-9), validating if they decode correctly (form completely the numbers), ranking them lexicographically, and extra post-processing for the ones having maximum decoding options. Dynamic programming could be applied here as caching of map results of each "?" position.

**Note:** The logic involves checking combinations for `?`s, counting their valid permutations, ranking based on their decode possibilities, and then selecting the \(K\)th largest. Let's implement this stepwise:

1. Loop through the string, generate permutations for `?`s.
2. For each new permutation, check the decode string permutations and count valid permutations.
3. Sort and rank these permutations.
4. Consider only the one with maximum counts, find the \(K\)th largest, and the respective count of valid decode strings.

We need to first uncorrupt the encoded string, ensuring all parts of the string are valid according to the rules of the cipher. For all possible uncorrupted strings that yield the maximum number of decoded strings, we output the lexicographically \(K\)th-largest one along with the count of such strings.

1. Invoke a dynamic programming function to count all valid splits given a valid encoded string `E`. We aim to find the number of possible ways to arrange for a valid sequence; it will be the last element in the DP table.
2. Invoke a function to count the number of uncorrupted strings that yield the max number of decoded strings.
3. Track the locations of corrupted characters within each potential uncorrupted string.
4. Invoke a shifting function that determines the smallest allowed possible number in a spot that can be shifted to yield a new potential uncorrupted string with the same number of valid splits, changing this single '?' to a digit.
5. Terminate when the correct \(K\)th option is found, or we're out of spots to shift.

<observation>If the question mark is followed by a non-zero number, there are two ways to decode it. The question mark can be considered as "1" (making the number from the current question mark to next following digit (if it exists) into a two-digit number) or as "0".</observation>

We need to generate all possible decodings of the uncorrupted encoded string derived from the input, each with their associated count of permutations. Given these possibilities, we then identify the string with the highest possible count of valid decoded strings. Notice that by replacing question marks with `0` or `1`, we maximize the opportunity for 2-digit numbers, which effectively corresponds to multiple three-way decisions where each question mark is part of a two-digit number or else interpreted as a single digit.

Given the large values of \( |E| \) and \( K \), applying dynamic programming combined with recursion and memoization to pre-compute valid strings is effective. For every instance of `?`, we have a choice of making it `0` or `1`, provided this doesn't cause leading zeroes.

For each possible uncorrupted encoded string, we then compute the number of valid decoded strings, tracking a running maximum as we go. Given the possibility of multiple valid strings having the same maximum count, we sort them lexicographically to find the \( K \)th largest.

### Precomputed Quantities:
- Given \(T\) sequences of a certain size to decode, using \(\binom{T}{X}\) indicates the ways to intersperse the sequences in optimal positions.
- Let’s construct a function which starts from the positions in the decoded string. When we reach a character, we proceed with it. We need to count the ways of making such patterns.

The precomputation is part of \(\mathcal{O}(D)\) time, leading to an overall \(\mathcal{O}(N + D)\) complexity.

The constraints indicate that the string length \(|E|\) is at most \(100{,}000\), and recursion deeply may exceed time allowance. We can solve with a dynamic program approach based on states (dp) on ranges divided into 3 cases: whether the current substring is `?`, ends at position greater than \(2\), or ends at \(1\) or \(2\).
</constraint_analysis>
<observations>
<observation>
String can be divided into substrings of the form \(abc\), where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) all start with some digit or `?` and the transitions are valid, \(a\) has length \(1\), \(2\), or \(3\) and \(b\) transitions validly from it.
</observation>
<observation>
If current substring ends at position \(1\) or \(2\), it can be decoded to \(1\) decoded string or \(2\) decoded strings at most. When replacing `?` with all possible replacements and transitioning to remaining substrings, the number of decoded strings remains unchanged.
</observation>
<observation>
If current substring ends at position \(>2\), it must start with either `1` or `2` and the second digit must be less than or equal to \(6`. To achieve the maximum number of decoded strings, the most robust strategy is to replace all `?` with \(1\), except if the substring is directly followed by a digit or by `?` where the next digit ends with \(7\)-`9`. In such a situation, we should replace the previous `?` with `2`.
</observation>
<observation>
We add additional `?` whenever the substring transitions to the next digit to ensure the most robust \(dp\) state carries over.
</observation>
<observation>
To approximate \(dp\) with transition state, we can precompute possible values in two tables: \(a_v[p]\) which represents largest string representing number \(p\) ending at range \([0, i]\) and \(b_v[p]\) which represents second largest string among remaining choices, also ending at range \([0, i]\).
</observation>
<observation>
The lexicographically greatest string will be from \(a_v[p]\) and the second largest string will be from \(b_v[p]\). For frequency, two transitions impact the final count: \(11\rightarrow 11\) or \(11\rightarrow 2\) with \(11\) at most \(p-1\) followed by any second choice from previous cached states, and \(1-120 \rightarrow 10\) or \(1-120 \rightarrow 12\) without changing the counter.

### Let's Break Down the Problem and Solution:

A simple strategy for maximizing decodings is ensuring each string of numbers (introduced by replacing question marks) can potentially form multiple chunks with maximum flexibility in interpretation boundaries. Prior to applying dp, pre-work involves generating candidate strings replacing '?' that can maximize such flexibility.

The dp aspect can maintain a count array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of ways to decode a sequence ending with the `i`th valid number and considering the `j`th question mark has just been processed.

This should be accompanied with a partition function to assess split points validity and compute multiplication for segment counts, balancing leading zeros and edge cases, moving from string's end towards the start.

An additional part of the issue is identifying the \(K\)th lexicographically largest uncorrupted string. Given the large number of possible replacements for '?', a segment-wise enumeration and comparison routine following a lexicographic dictionary order check is used to identify it.

Since the number of decodings of an uncorrupted string can be described via Fibonacci numbers, it's useful to track which strings provide the highest counts and in what order. To achieve this efficiently without computing every possible combination, we only keep track of the best scores and the strings that score them.

Here's the approach:
1. Sort the string so we consider '?' placements from largest value.
2. For each group of digits or '?':
    - Determine valid character placements based on length (1 to 2 for a group of size 2).
    - Use Fibonacci numbers for the number of decodings.
3. Count decodings for various versions of a string, storing only best counts.
4. Store only best \(K\) strings according to lexicographical order.
5. For all potential candidates, cache the best \(K\) and their counts.

# Implementation Plan
1. **Counting Valid Decoding Sequences:** 
   Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode a given string if there are no question marks. Define `dp(pos)` as the number of ways to decode the remaining string starting at position `pos`.
   
2. **Handling Question Marks:** 
   Replace each `?` in a way that maximizes the number of valid decodings. Replace a `?` with a digit (`1` to `9`) and calculate the number of decoded strings. Store the maximum count and lexico-maximum string.

3. **String Splitting Logic:**
   Split the string into various possible decodings and check the length and order. For each `?`, we can replace it with `1` to `9` and move to the next position.

4. **DP Table:**
   Use a `dp` table to find the ways to decode the given string. For each possible deconstruction starting at `pos`, make a recursive call to find the deconstruction count.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   Store the counts modulo \(998,244,353\) and output the \(K\)th string in lexicographical order amongst the uncorrupted strings achieving the maximum decoding count.

<paraphrased>
We are given a string `E` containing digits and `?` characters. Our objective is to replace `?` characters with digits such that when `E` is split into numbers within the range 1 to 26, it maximizes the number of possible valid decode strings. If multiple replacements yield the same maximum number of decoded strings, we select the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string. We also report the count of these decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The character set includes digits and question marks, where `?` can be amended to any digit (0-9). The encoded string can hide multiple valid decodings but we must find the most versatile arrangement.

# Constraints
* Each test case string `E` can have up to \(100{,}000\) characters.
* Each test case `K` value can range up to \(1{,}000{,}000\).
* The sum of lengths across all test cases is capped at \(400{,}000\).

# Analysis
* The first task is to process the string and calculate the number of possible decodings.
  * For an uncorrupted string \(S\), the number of ways to decode it is known based on recursive DP ($\mathcal{O}(n)$).
* The second task is trying every pattern of replacing `?`, which is \(\mathcal{O}(10^{\text{numberOfQuestionMarks}})\) but bounded effectively by \(10^{5}\).
* A decomposition yields \(\mathcal{O}(10^5 * 1000)\) per string on average, given \(25\) tries for every set of `?`.
* Thus, the problem is feasible within the given constraints.

# Observations
* When replacing question marks, different replacements can lead to different decode strings.
* Leading zeros are invalid, so `13 5 01` is invalid and should be handled appropriately.
* Use dynamic programming to compute the number of possible decodings for each candidate string correction.
* Lexicographical ordering helps in choosing the \(K\)th best-correction string.
* Keep a dictionary or data structure to store the counts of decode strings for each candidate.
* A search space optimization could focus on characters around the question marks, as they directly impact decode configurations.

The optimal approach leverages dynamic programming to count decodings and keeping a tracking structure for the prefixes. Given `E`, we iterate through each index, handling '?' and converting it to an appropriate digit that maximizes the decodings. Eventually by leveraging lexicographic orderings, we track and find the lexicographically \(K\)th string from among those with the maximum decodings.

**Flow of solution:**

1. Convert each '?' in the encoded string into a digit so as to achieve maximum decodings, considering valid digits (1-9) exclusively.
2. Utilize dynamic programming (DP) to count maximum decodings for encoded strings, storing values at indexes of strings. States are substrings of the encoded version of \(E\).
3. We calculate the decodings by treating every valid prefix as potential results and incrementing a counter dynamically over all segments.
4. Maintain track of prefix segments ensuring it decodes into valid strings with at most two characters.
5. Precompute all possible decoded sequences for each string leading up to it. Also, store the lexicographically \(K\)th one per condition.
6. Finally, iterate over from generated segments and identify the provided \(K\)th string with maximum matches, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

**Crucial challenges:**

1. Maximizing the number of decoded sequences depends on strategically choosing digits to replace '?'.
2. Properly handling the lexicographic order, especially when seeking the \(K\)th string, can introduce complexity.
3. Managing large strings and memoized sequences effectively.

In this task, we need to uncorrupt the string in a manner that maximizes the number of possible interpretations it can have, with multiple question marks. Given the constraints, it's not feasible to try every single possible combination of numbers for the question marks. Instead, we'll use dynamic programming, specifically DP on substrings, and also leverage graph theory to effectively count the number of ways to split a string into 1-26.

To approach this:

1. Initialize a DP array `dp[i]` which represents the number of ways an uncorrupted substring starting at position `i` can be interpreted. Set `dp[N] = 1` as the base condition, where `N = |E|`.

2. For each substring starting at `i` and ending at `i + 1` to `i + 2`, if it forms a valid number (between 1 and 26), add the number of interpretations from the position right after it (`dp[i+2]`) to `dp[i]`.

3. To generate the lexicographically largest uncorrupted string, start by replacing all question marks with '9' (maximum digit). Check the DP count. If we still have more K strings to generate, decrement the value at each corrupted digit from the right until we get to the Kth string.

4. Lastly, the number of interpretations is computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Here's how it could look implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int T;
string E;
const int MOD = 998244353;
long long dp[100005];

long long f(int i, string &E) {
    if (i >= E.size()) return 1;
    if (dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];
    dp[i] = 0;
    if (E[i] == '?') {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 9; j++) {
            E[i] = j + '0';
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + f(i+1, E)) % MOD;
        }
    } else if (i + 1 < E.size() && E[i+1] == '?') {
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            if (E[i] != '0' && (long long)(E[i] - '0') * 10 + j + 1 <= 26) {
                E[i+1] = j + '0';
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + f(i+2, E))

The strategy involves:
1. **Formation of Graph Representation:**
    Given an encoded string, edges define its possible graph interpretations. For a two-character segment `xy`, there's a directed edge from `xy` to `x` (if `x` is a valid number) and an edge to `y` (if both `xy` and `y` are valid). If there are two question marks, an edge points to `xy` from each possible digit.

2. **Counting Reachable Nodes Using DP:** The number of string interpretations `f(u)` hints at the number of ways that each segment can be unique; this value can be computed for each node `u`.

3. **Finding Maximum Possible Reachable Nodes:** With each node's `f` values, we ascertain the highest possible `f(u)`.

4. **Identifying Lexicographically Largest String among Graph Nodes:**
    - Store in an array and sort nodes in best-to-worst order (largest lexicographically, greatest `f` value). Then, count through sorted array till we reach the K-th node.

5. **Special Case Handling:**
    - If `K` is larger than the number of equivalent best answers, report the lexicographically least of those answers.
    - If `K` is exactly the number of equivalent best answers, return the lexicographically highest string with ties resolved lexicographically.

<impl_details>
In each test case, we obtain a string \(E\) and an integer \(K\), and the goal is to first rebuild \(E\) by replacing all `?` characters with digits \(1\) to \(9\) (noting `10` to `19` are invalid as leading zeros), in such a way as to maximize the number of possible decodings. This problem can be approached as follows:

### Key Observations
1. The question marks in \(E\) represent uncertainties in the encoded string, and we need to determine the best way to replace them to yield the maximum number of valid decodings.
2. Each pair of digits (or a single digit) from `1` to `26` can represent one letter in the decoded string.
3. To determine the possibility count and the corresponding string, dynamic programming with memoization can be applied.

### Solution Steps:
1. Recursively or iteratively traverse the string and compute the number of possible decodings considering each uncorrupted digit.
2. Store results in memoization table to optimize multiple calculations.
3. Identify the lexicographically \(K\)-th largest string for the maximum number of decodings.
</impl_details>
<steps>
- Store each possible valid string in a list and its corresponding de-coding count in a hash map.
- Use dynamic programming and memoization to compute the de-coding count for various uncorrupted combinations.
- Find the lexicographically largest \(K\)-th string or the first one with maximum decodings.
- Output lexicographically largest uncorrupted string and corresponding decoding count modulo $998,244,353$.
</steps>

</tags>

First, we need a mechanism to handle the task of generating all reasonable replacements for a given segment (defined by question marks) in \(E\). This is done by a recursive function that stores each valid replacement and the count of possible decodings due to that replacement. We iterate through each character, recursively replace every `?` with a digit from `1` to `9` to form potential decodings and memoize these findings.

If we are given `?35`, we must try `135`, `235`, ..., `935`. It's clear that any value other than `1` or `2` must be counted separately:

For `135`:
- Could decode into `135` or `13 5`.

For `235`:
- Only decodes into `23 5`.

If we have a string like `1?2`, the replacement can be `112`, `12 2`, etc.

The goal is to find the lexicographically largest string amongst all replacements for each case, and record them in sorted order. 

When \(K\) is asked, return the \(K\)-th largest string and the count of possible decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Given a corrupted encoded string $E$, which consists of digits and question marks, we need to fill the question marks to create a valid uncorrupted string. This string should then be split into numbers between 1 and 26, with each possible way of splitting yielding a valid decoded string. We seek the uncorrupted string that has the maximum number of such decoded strings and return the \(K\)th lexicographically largest among these. Finally, we output the number of decoded strings modulo \(998,244,353\).

<observation>For the number of possible decodings of E, we can use dynamic programming (DP). Let dp(i) hold the number of possible decodings starting at E[i:]. Assume that the input always has at least one valid decoding.</observation>
<observation>The recursion is dp(i) = dp(i+1) possible if E[i] is not a question mark (we must not be prepending a 0), else to dp(i+1) + dp(i+2) if the next character is in [0,9] and E[i:i+2] evaluates to an integer between 1-26, else 0 if prepending 0 violates one of these conditions.</observation>

<observation>To get the lexicographically K-th largest string among those with the maximum number of decoded strings, we perform a try-and-error-like algorithm. We iterate through the string, trying to replace every question mark with digits, with an aim to create as many valid substring splits as possible.

Given a string $E$ and a positive integer $K$, we are to decipher $E$ into the lexicographically $K^{\text{th}}$ encoded string among those with the most possible encoded strings. 

Let’s define a DP array $dp$, where $dp[i]$ refers to the number of ways string $E[i..]$ can be decoded into a sequence of integers between $1$ and $26$. This DP array is predictable after prefilling some boundary condition:

1. If a string is a leading zero (e.g., 11023 might have 11 23 as the option if splitting long-array starts with a leading ‘0’), it should make no contribution to decoding. Hence if it is a “leading zero” boundary, dp[i] = 0.
2. If the string at index i is exactly a single character and is valid (i.e., $1 \leq E[i] \leq 9$), dp[i] = 1 because it decodes in just one way.

The transitions look like this:

- If the length of the remaining string is just one (single digit), it can only be decoded in one way, as it must be a single digit.
- We compute $dp[i]$ based on $dp[i+1]$, and if we’re able to form a 2-digit group without exceeding $26$, we also factor in $dp[i+2]$, since reading it as a two-digit number counts as a different valid segment.

We work in reverse from the end of the string to the beginning. If we find multiple solutions, sort them lexicographically.

For generating the $K$th lexicographically smallest uncorrupted string like our example “?35?01” into the top-decoded string, we need to apply the same logic where any “?” can be adjusted to a valid string under decode conditions.

Here is an example of a possible implementation focusing on efficiency due to the constraints mentioned.

<description>
To solve the problem, we will use dynamic programming. We need to identify valid split points and count the number of ways to uncorrupt the string \(E\) to maximize the number of decoded strings.

1. Create two arrays `x` and `y` to store the number of ways to uncorrupt the string up to the current position ensuring the current position is inclusive and exclusive respectively.
2. Iterate over the string \(E\) and update these arrays based on the current character being a digit or a `?`.
3. If the character is a digit, propagate values between arrays depending on the value (valid or invalid split).
4. If the character is a `?`, update the number of possible splits by adding values from both arrays.
5. After processing \(E\), find the valid ends of strings by iterating backwards.
6. Determine the maximum number of possible decoded strings and select the \(K\)th largest string to output.
7. Calculate the number of possible decoded strings using combinatorial approach.

Note that the number of positions to split the string could be more than \(1000000\), which would be too large to enumerate hence the use of dynamic programming to keep track.

Given a string \(E\) containing digits and `?` characters, we aim to find the \(K\)-th largest uncorrupted string encoding that maximizes the number of decoding possibilities. Leading zeros are not treated as valid, so there are several ways to form proper encoded strings.

First, replace the `?`s and split the string into parts, and count how many valid decoded strings there may be. Let's denote \(dp[i][j]\) as the number of ways to uncorrupt \(E[:i]\) such that the last character is the \(j\)th index of the string. Restoring incorrect splits may require maximum number of subproblems.

1. Replace each `?` with a digit `0` - `9`.
2. Split into two groups: one that forms numbers, the other treats as 10+ numbers.
3. Keep only valid splits and count strings; perform combinatorial counting using dynamic programming.
4. Store and sum valid counts using dynamic programming or memoization strategies.
5. For finding the \(K\)-th largest uncorrupted string, prioritizing the split that maximizes the number of possibilities, starting from the largest. Count valid suffixes recursively using memoization.

To minimize the lexicographical order, start by treating `?` as `0` if enlarging splits results in valid numbers. When processing splits, prefer earlier splits if they don't exceed \(10\).

</paraphrasing>

<paraphrased>
We have an encoded string $E$ containing digits and question marks, where each `?` can be any digit. Objective: convert question marks to digits to maximize the possible number of decoded strings. Each decoded string should form valid characters (A-Z) translating numbers from 1 to 26.

For instance, to uncorrupt and decode a sample string `?35?01`, options include `135201` which decode into `MEBTAT` and `135201` into `ACETA`. Determine the uncorrupted string that has maximum possible decoded strings, and find the lexicographically K-th such string.

Let's explore how to calculate and maximize decoded strings for any uncorrupted string:

Each 1 to 1 digit string represents one valid character, and combinations involving 10 to 26 represent valid multi-digit sequences. 

For calculating each decodable string:
- Single digits (1-9) each correspond to up to 9 unique decoded strings.
- Two-digit combinations (10 to 26) yield a maximum possible string count based on how we split adjacent digits.
- Example: `?2?` can correspond to `20`, `12`, `112`, `111` plus variations due to `?` filling.

Our focus is to maximize lexicographic order while achieving maximum possible decoded strings count.

### Calculations

- Let's calculate possibilities with and without question marks:
    - With question marks: individual digits transform directly, and every `?` can be every relevant 1 to 9 digit.
    - The Bellman-Held-Karp dynamic programming approach helps in calculating combinations, but rather than store tuples, keep count of string possibilities every place.

### Maximum String Calculation
Given a potential string factor is significant 123 combinations, and thus single-purpose dynamic programming solutions tend towards infeasible memory and computational burdens. 

Using the generalized:
- For each part of string, sum the combinations achieved ignoring a `?` or filling `?` with any digit within the valid contribution to string.

### Lexicographically kth largest string
- Key is storing and comparing every form of known maximum
- Sort & directly accessing the \(K\)th-largest encoding following all possibilities.

### Implementation Insights
Given string length constraints, assume question marks alter decoded string counts via ignoring undetermined `?` positions:

- For \(E\): pre-calculated string tries in every possible combination.
- Order their potential decoded string counts.

The key is to encode the maximization of different possible decoded strings through optimizations. We recast the problem using F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1 in the Fibonacci sequence, where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) captures the count of distinct splits for substrings of length \(n\).

We aim to optimize prefix and suffix filled with '?'s into valid substrings such that the Fibonacci sequence count maximizes for the given remaining parts. For each '?' position, we consider each possible digit it could be replaced with, and then dp[i] will be the maximum count reaches up to position i.

Each combination incrementally checks possibilities by skipping or considering last character if forming a valid segment, leveraging precomputed counts from smaller substrings.

From the dp array, we then find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest combination by iteratively forming strings with the optimal replacements and storing them for later sorting and selection.

Given a corrupted encoded string E containing digits and question marks, the task is to replace the question marks with digits to obtain a valid encoded string. The encoded string should allow for the maximum number of decoded strings when split into numbers between $1$ and $26$, inclusive. If multiple encoded strings yield the same maximum number of decoded strings, we output the lexicographically $K$th largest string among them. The final output consists of this string and the count of possible decoded strings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

Each test case has a maximum length of 100,000 characters for \(E\), and across all test cases the total length does not exceed 400,000 characters. Modifying the string length step by step requires a linear scan or dynamic programming approach.

The subtask based on usage of \((T | E | K)\) places restrictions:
- The sum of \(|E|\) for all test cases is at most \(400,000\).
- \(K\) must not exceed the total number of valid permutations.

To decode a possible maximum number of strings, prior to expansion each question mark should be made part of the smallest number possible that makes the decoded string valid (without leading zeros).

Revised Approach:
To address this problem efficiently, let's design the solution step by step. We need to maximize the number of valid splits while also ensuring we can list all valid uncorrupted sequences lexicographically.

1. Transform the input string $E$ into segments that maximize the splitting into valid numbers.
2. Find all possible ways to replace `?` with digits from `1` to `9` such that the resultant transformations maximize the number of valid splits.
3. Ensure that split intervals are within 1-26 and maintain a DP array across the string to record valid ways of splitting.
4. Keeping track of possible splits and the final state array, compile possible outputs and perform lexicographical sorts.
5. For each transformation, calculate the count of valid splits using DFS and memoization to avoid rerunning.
6. Sort possible transformations and output the $K$th transformation, alongside the number of valid decodings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

## Approach:

1. **State and Initialization**: Define \(f[i]\) as the maximum number of decoded strings from the \([1, i]\) substring of uncorrupted string \(S\) and \(s[i]\) as the lexicographically smallest string \(S\) as mentioned above. 
2. **Subproblems and Recurrence**: \(f[i] = 1\) if \(s[i] = 0\), otherwise, \(f[i] = (f[i-1] + f[i-2] + ... + f[i-\text{a}_i]) \mod 998244353\) where \(\text{a}_i\) is the length of the max substring within the end that is a valid character between `10` and `26`.
3. **Answer Calculation**: When \(f[i]\) becomes greater than \(K\), backtrack to construct the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string.
4. **Optimization**: Use prefix sums for linear time splits and keep track of uncorrupted strings during computation.

## Example - Contingencies:

Off the top of your head, you might think to brute force all possible uncorrupted strings \(10^m\). This doesn't easily work.

A more optimal approach would be to use a structured combinatorial search or dynamic programming to exploit structure and optimize on possible values.

Testing extreme cases with base values like fully corrupted or all values (1-certain max).

Code proceeds as follows:
   
1. **Preprocessing**: Extract digits and '?' and preprocess.
2. **Finding Max Possibilities**: Using DP on subsequences.
3. **Finding \(K\)th String**: 
   - Implement Binary Search for optimization.

Implement the solution in the format described:

To determine the maximum number of valid decodings for an encoded string, we can develop a recursive DP solution. We track the best decodings starting from each position in the string and evaluate the candidates which yield the maximum feasible split possibilities after substitution of any query marks into valid digits. Transforming between equal-maximum decodings sets, we identify the lexicographically K-th largest.

Whenever a `?` appears, enumerate over each legal substitution digit (from `1` to `9`), relaying the split combinatorial processing in each change, recursively. We propagate memoized information on best candidate counts for convenience. To ensure efficient enumeration and maximal result evaluation, modular arithmetic is applied at each computation layer.

Note: An optimized approach requires keeping only two arrays' states, eliminating unnecessary space expansion.

The goal is to find the string which allows the most possible ways to decode it into separate numbers. The approach involves generating all possible strings by replacing `?` with `1` or `2`, calculating the number of ways each string can be split into valid encodings, and finding the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string that allows the maximum number of splits.

Here is one possible implementation:

### Steps:
1. Build a DP array that will store the number of possible ways each prefix of the string can be decoded up to the previous two possible splits.
2. For each `?`, consider both '1' and '2', update possible splits along the entire DP array.
3. Use a backtracking function to generate the largest lexicographic possible string.

### Implementation
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;

// Helper function to generate all splits starting from index
long long dp[100002][3] = {0};

long long calculateMaxEncodeWays(string& code, int index) {
    if (index >= code.size()) return 1;
    if (dp[index][0] != -1) return dp[index][0];

Given a mixed encoded string E containing digits and question marks, we aim to first uncorrupt it by replacing each question mark with a digit. Once that's done, the task is to split the uncorrupted string into segments, each segment being a number between 1 and 26 inclusive. Our objective is to find the uncorrupted string that can be decoded into the maximum number of valid strings, and determine the lexicographically \(K\)th such string. Finally, we're required to return count of those decoding possibilities modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The algorithm works in two parts. In the first part, we parse each substring or run of numbers/`?`. Significant regions of the string get treated in parallel, converting ranges of `?` into potential runs of digits. We also identify how many ways we can split them. We accumulate results with a DP, recording the possible number of valid decodepaths and their lexicographical order info. In this DP:

- `dp[i][j]` = total ways to decode the first \(i\) digits by ending at split \(j\)
- `lex[i][j]` = lexicographical ordering within the DP state of i ending at split j

In the second part, we add each piece to the highest generating maximum total `i` ways in lexicographical order. This uses a second `inverted lex dp`. Finally we compute the `kth` smallest lexicographic string among the max decodings and the count modulo the given limit.

<paraphrased>
Given a encoded string E with potential ? symbols, the goal is to uncorrupt the strings, ensuring that each section between splits represents a digit between 1 and 26. The task is to find the uncorrupted version of E which can be decoded into the maximum number of distinct strings, and amongst those, return the Kth lexicographically largest string. The output must also include the count of all possible decoded strings for that string, modulo \(998,244,353\).

Will leverage a dynamic programming approach to handle both encoding and counting feasibility checks recursively. The approach will ensure maximum possible decodable combinations keeping encodings valid.

1. Replace '?' characters with digits to make valid decodings.
2. Use DFS with backtracking to recursively evaluate all possible splits.
3. Store intermediate results and avoid duplicate calculations.
4. Keep track of max valid decoded cases from each possible split.
5. Sort final uncorrupted strings based on lexicographical order.
6. Extract the Kth string based on order.

- Some digits can be `?`, representing uncertainty; replace each with the digits `0` through `9`.

</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
Given a corrupted encoded string \(E\) consisting of digits and question marks (`?`), the task is to uncorrupt \(E\) by replacing `?` with digits 0-9 such that the number of valid ways to split the uncorrupted string into segments of valid character codes (1-26) is maximized. Additionally, we seek the \(K\)-th largest uncorrupted string in lexicographical order if there are multiple optimal uncorrupted strings.

# Constraints Analysis
- Length of \(E\) can be up to \(100{,}000\)
- The number of test cases, \(T\), is at most \(85\)
- Sum of \(|E|\) across all cases does not exceed \(400{,}000\)
- \(K\) varies from 1 to \(1{,}000{,}000\)
An \(O(|E|^2)\) or better solution is required to handle the constraints effectively.

# Dynamic Programming Approach
To count valid splits, we use a DP table, \(DP[j]\), which marks whether substrings ending at \(j\) can be decoded. We also maintain a DP array to track the number of ways to decode the string up to a given point. Additionally, we track the best strings in a list.

Each position in the string can be linked to the previous 1 or 2 positions, considering the magnitude of 26. By iterating and backtracking over all digits and question marks, we can calculate the lexicographically requested encoding.

- If the current character is a digit, check if the digit alone or combined with the previous digit forms a valid segment.
- If it's a `?`, each digit replacement expands the number of viable decodings.
- Prune invalid cases early to minimize computation.

Tracking the best split counts, we can identify multiple candidates sharing the highest score. Among them, the $K$-th largest uncorrupted string is found using lexicographical ordering.

To solve this problem, we need to ensure the string is split into chunks which correspond to valid letters (1-26), handle question marks appropriately, and identify the optimal uncorrupted string among all feasible uncorrupted ones. 

The global objective is to maximize the number of decode methods possible. Each question mark "?" can be transformed into a digit between 0-9, enabling additional potential decodings. The output request is to return the lexicographically \(K\)th such string along with the prime count of ways it can be decoded modulo \(p\).

We need to uncorrupt a given string $E$ containing digits and question marks. The goal is to replace every '?' with a valid digit (0-9) such that the number of possible decoded strings from the resultant uncorrupted string is maximized. Each valid decoded string should consist of parts where each part represents a character from A-Z (1-26) in a classic substitution cipher. The program should also output the $K$th largest, lexicographically, among these uncorrupted strings that yield the maximum number of decodings.

Note: Leading zeros are not allowed in parts of a decoded string.

To solve this efficiently we will:
1. Preprocess the string and replace each '?' with the characters '0' and '9'.
2. Compute a dynamic programming table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of decodable segments we can get starting from position `i` considering a span (segment) of length `j`.
3. Track the required format for $K$th lexicographic order during the DP journey, this involves a recursive function to navigate the possible combinations.
4. Evaluate each string based on the modified formula and extract the required lexicographical order.

The base of the calculation involves converting a single '?' into either '09' or '19' and compute the combinatory possibilities from that, avoiding invalid formations because of leading '0'.

To further enable step 3, additional tracking is needed - specifically how many options we have once the split has been created. For example, if we have `"???"`, expanding it through possible splits could provide multiple mappings, deriving the total number of decodings.

Lastly, after computing `dp` and the required string candidates, we apply a lexicographically comparison and filtration step to select the correct $K$th candidate as specified.

Complexity: The preprocessing is linear, the DP phase can be linear to quadratic and the final string comparison is also linear or quadratic worst case.

In essence, a string with `?` can be varied up to \(99\) times for `??` instances, and the constraints favor grouping into as many valid double-digit characters as possible, with valid one-digit characters assigned elsewhere.

To solve:

1. **Identify 'slack' positions** where `?`s could be double or single digits without conflict. Need to evaluate every position up to \(K\).
2. **For every position**, calculate the number of decodings if treated as `1x` (where x is any digit), or `2x`.
3. **Combinations exploration** for `??` positions happens in lexicographically minimal order.
4. **Combine data** to decide placements.
5. **Generate K**th decoded string from position evaluations and combinations exploration.
6. **Compute modulo** \(998{,}244{,}353\) the final number of decodings.

**Complexity**: \(O(|E|^2) = 10^9\) operations for Kth generation and decoding counts. Manage by pruning or memoizing certain calculations.

Given the constraints, we need to solve this problem efficiently by considering dynamic programming to count split possibilities, and optimizing output through lexicographical sorting afterward. Here's a compact approach:

1. **Count Splits**: Use DP to count possible valid splits for substrings up to any position.
2. **Store Results**: Track valid splits and uncorruption options.
3. **Identify Max**: Identify uncorruptions leading to maximum splits.
4. **Select Lexico**: Among the max ones, select the \(K\)th lexico option.
5. **Output**: Derived uncorrupted string and its encoding count modulo \(M\).

<paraphrased>
An input string $E$ contains digits and question marks. The task involves replacing question marks with digits and splitting the result, while ensuring each resulting group is between 1 and 26. The goal is to find which replacements yield the maximum possible number of decodings and then produce the \(K\)th lexicographically largest uncorrupted string that achieves this maximum. Additionally, the maximum number of decodings for this string should be output, modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

## Observations:
<observation>To maximize the number of decodings, corrupted segments should either be single digits or two digits where the first digit can be $1$ or $2$.</observation>
<observation>We can calculate the potential number of decodings for each split point where the string changes to '?' to new digits.</observation>
<observation>Once we know all valid splits and their associated number of decodings, we sort all valid sequences and retrieve the \(K\)th sequence.</observation>
<observation>Maximizing combinations ensures that multi-digit possibilities are utilized for maximum decodings.</observation>
<observation>Note that $998{,}244{,}353$ is a prime number to apply modular arithmetic for efficient computation.</observation>
<observations>

For this problem we need to start by ensuring that no digit sequence starts with an invalid character such as '0'. We also need to manage splitting points systematically; at each '?' position, we'll need to decide if it should be a single-digit replacement or a part of a two-digit replacement with its next digit. 

**Steps:**

1. Identify all positions that could be either splits or part of two-digit sequences.
2. Calculate the possible number of decodings for each interpretation of the '?'.
3. Determine the maximum number of decodings.
4. Find the lexicographically \(K\)th uncorrupted string.
5. Implement modular arithmetic for large number outputs.

In this problem, our goal is to take a string with question marks, uncorrupt it, and find the maximal count of ways to decode it while also finding the \(K\)th largest lexicographic arrangement of those strings with the maximum decode count. 

Input:
```
E = '??2', K = 3
```
Encode decoding possibilities from ?:
```
'222': decodes to `CC`, (`2`)
'212': decodes to `CB`, `AC`
'122': `AB`, `LC`
'112': Only 1
```
To solve, utilize dynamic programming for computing decode counts and backtracking with a heap for finding $K$th largest option efficiently. 

In practice, it would look something like:
```cpp
#define ll long long

ll maxSumWays(string &S, int k) {
    SI dp[100005], q;
    fill(dp, dp + 100005, 0);
    dp[Sz(S)] = 1;
    q.push(make_pair(1, Sz(S)));
    int c = -1;
    while (!q.empty() && c == -1) {
        pair<int, int> t = q.top(); q.pop();
        int a = t.second;
        while (a && !isalpha(S[a - 1])) {
            dp[--a] = (t.first + (a + 1 < Sz(S) ? dp[a + 1] : 0)) % mod;
            if (c == -1 && dp[a] >= k) c = dp[a];
            if (dp[a] && a + 1 <= Sz(S)) q.push(make_pair(dp[a], a));
        }
    }
    
    if (c == -1) return -1;

    k--;
    string sol = ""; 
    int last = 0;
    int i = 0;
    
    while (i <= Sz(S)) k -= dp[i], last = i;

### Explanation

Each sequence of `?` can be interpreted in several different ways, affecting the count of possible decodings of the relaxed string. Each sequence of digits corresponds to Fibonacci numbers or a scaled-down version of Fibonacci numbers, depending on the length of the sequence. Specifically, each sequence of `?` of length \(k\) can represent \(9^k\) potential values if unrestricted.

For example, `?3` can be decoded into `13` or `13` (ignoring invalid encodings), or disambiguated choices if we split them validly (e.g., `13`).

The splitting optimization leverages the observation that we only need to consider splits that give us integers \(\leq 26\) for every contiguous piece of uncorrupted string.

We use the same optimization of keeping only two rows in our DP arrays, leading to a memory-efficient implementation.

Let's use a dynamic programming approach to determine the number of ways to decode a given string. We can use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters of the encoded string. We initially set `dp[0] = 1` because an empty string has one way to be decoded (doing nothing). For each character, we decide whether it can be a single digit or part of a double-digit number. 

To also generate uncorrupted strings, a recursive backtracking technique can be employed. Specifically during backtracking, we aim to replace each '?' digitwise with all possible digits from `0` to `9`. Note that ‘?’ in a lead position, e.g., `?10`, should be replaced with digits `1` through `9`.

    skipped %= mod;
    return dp[index] = (skipped += getDecodings(s, index + 1))%mod;

We need to consider both the uncorrupted strings and their counts of possible decoded strings. By "uncorrupted", we have a string with only digits and no leading zeros. We define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode `E[i:]` modulo \(998,244,353\).

- If `E[i]` is `?`, then we try `dp[i] += dp[i + 2]` if `E[i:i + 2]` is a valid split (i.e., from `10` to `26`). We also add `dp[i + 1]` if `E[i]` itself is a valid split (i.e., any digit `1` to `9`).

String sanitization is required to handle leading zeros and prepare strings with `?` substituted by digits appropriately.

Once we iterate through `E` starting from each possible `i` and fill the `dp` table, we use `dp[0]` to get the number of decoded string possibilities.

Time Complexity \(O(|E|)\) per test case.

<approach>
Compute the possible decodings recursively and memorize substrings that we've calculated so that we can save compute time for other probable substrings from the inputs.

But, instead of looking for the uncorrupted string giving \(max\) number of decodes, we look for the \(K-th\) largest one such that these decodes are as large as possible. For this, breadth-first DFS and dynamic programming over possible uncorrupted strings can be utilized.

To further avoid repeating effort we also use a dedicated format to store the string and avoid leading zeros.

We break E at every possible point to find the max possible decode value for index, and along that way ensure we only count the K-th largest candidate.

In any section of the string, the number of decodings is the sum of the number of valid decodings just before the section and the number of decodings resulting from the section itself, half of which starts with a `0`, `1`, ..., `9` followed by `0` ... `9`. Relevant prefixes get memorized for quick lookup and reuse.

We can use a BFS-like approach to explore all possible replacements equally and proceed with the lexicographically K-th largest as a priority.

We keep a highest count, and a priority queue that contains some number of potential candidates. We insert potential candidates into the priority queue.

Given a string with digits and question marks, we need to replace all question marks with digits to form an encoded string that, when decoded, provides the maximum number of possible strings. The task is to find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest version of this uncorrupted string and the number of decoded strings it can generate, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We want to create as many valid decoded strings as possible by assigning digits to question marks and then splitting the uncorrupted string into substrings of valid lengths (between 1 and 2 digits). To optimize this, we should prioritize assigning larger digits to question marks whenever possible as it allows for multiple potential splits.

# Explanation
We use dynamic programming (DP) to create a lookup table for computing the number of ways each prefix in the string can be decoded.

First, we load the lookup table with possible configurations. If we encounter a digit (1 through 9), we can extend the previous results by 1. If we encounter a digit in the range of 10 through 26, we must account for extending from two numbers behind (indicating a skipped case where the leading digit was part of a double-digit group). 

When we encounter a question mark, it marks a position from which we can derive multiple split configurations, we explore single-digit splits to maximize potential decoded strings.

To handle the boundary conditions related to invalid splits, we ensure intermediate results don't create improperly split sequences.

Finally, we gather all possible uncorrupted strings derived from the string and compute their respective maximum numbers of decoded strings. We sort these strings to easily access the \(K\)th largest one. The count is stored in a buffer within a loop to ensure it never exceeds \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The result of query-processing is two fold: identifying the lexicographically maximum corrupted string with the most potential decodings, and the number of potential decodings for that string. 

To achieve this, we first replace all question marks with '0' to ensure a larger number of decodings and then use dynamic programming to compute the decodable permutations, modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

For computing the maximum lexicographic string that yields the highest number of possible decodings, we replace all question marks with the largest digit consistent with maintaining a valid string of decodable substrings.

A brute force recursive solution would try replacing each question mark with 0-9 and calculate the number of decodings, but this is inefficient. Instead, we use memoization or tabulation to prune common unfeasible cases.

The modulo operator ensures all outputs fit within our constraint limits. Complexities for these operations, like n^2, are within acceptable limits for \(n \leq 100{,}000\).

To find the most versatile decoding (one that can be decoded into the maximum number of strings), we must solve two main tasks: firstly, deciding every possible way to decode a continuous run of digits into numbers 1–26, and secondly, ranking these solutions lexicographically.

To tackle task one, we use dynamic programming to track the progressively accumulating count of decodes \(\text{dp}[i]\) starting at index \(i\). At any point \(i\), if the digit sequence extending from \(i\) can form up to a two-digit valid code, add respective counts to positions for extensions by \(1\) and \(2\) step lengths:

- If single digit, add \(\text{dp}[i+1] \leftarrow \text{dp}[i]\).
- If pair of digits smaller or equal to 26, then also add \(\text{dp}[i+2] \leftarrow \text{dp}[i]\).

As a special instance, if \(i\) closes a chain with a '?', suppose it represents every legal numerical value (either as \(x\) or \(0x\)). Update the DP accordingly for possible splits.

For task two, we list out each optimal string and find the \(K\)-th lexicographically largest. This process needs maintaining a sorted list of optimal strings to retrieve the \(K\)-th one.

Finally, provide a modulus \(998{,}244{,}353\) to answers.

# Key Idea
Given a string \(E\) with some digits and question marks (?), our goal is to replace the question marks with digits such that the resulting string can be decoded into the maximum number of different strings and determine the lexicographically \(K\)-th configuration among all possible configurations that achieve this maximum number of decodings.

We need to ensure that the resulting string does not start with a '0' and stays within the range \(1\) to \(26\) whenever split into smaller segments.

In lexicographical terms, it means that if there are multiple best configurations, we look at each and compare them to find the \(K\)-th largest.

# Approach
We solve this with DP. We'll build a DP table `dp[i][j]` which represents the number of distinct decoded strings and the current best configuration ending at the \(i\)-th position and having the last number ending at length \(j\).

1. Convert all question marks to the smallest possible digit (`1`), which is a valid lower bound to start building.
2. Compute the number of possible decoding starting at position 0 and ending at position \(i\) and having each character as a 2-digit number. Use recursion and memoization to build `dp[i][j]`.
3. To find the \(k\)-th best string, check strings ending at different lengths and see which one could potentially have \(k\) precedents. Print out the prefix that could be a valid string, start from the very beginning and work the way to the end position. Also, look back at how many distinct strings could be yielded by each valid configuration by updating a running sum `sum`.

The core idea of the solution is to handle the “?” as a wildcard and explore all possibilities to maximize the number of decodings. For smaller strings, a brute-force approach while keeping count of decoded strings could suffice. However, for larger inputs, we consider the large number of combinations due to the presence of `?`, indicating a complex solution.

We can categorize each “?” with every possible digit and compute the number of ways to decode it using a DP approach which aids in determining the K-th lexicographically largest string with the maximum number of decoded forms.

<paraphrased>
Given an encoded text string E consisting of digits and '?' characters, the task involves replacing all '?' characters to form all possible encoded strings. The primary goal is to determine which uncorrupted encoded string allows for the maximal number of distinct decoding versions, while ensuring that the number groups adhere to the constraints of being in the range 1 to 26 without any leading zeros. Additionally, we are required to identify the lexicographically Kth largest uncorrupted encoded string among the maximal ones, and report the total number of such decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
The sum of \(|E|\) across all test cases is at most \(400{,}000\). A best choice is thus O(N) or O(N log N).
</constraint_analysis>
<strategy_steps>
The key steps are:
1. Define a function to count the number of ways to decode the currently corrupted encoded string given current and next positions. This is a dynamic programming step with caching.
2. Generate all possible ways to reconstitute a given uncorrupted encoded string, in lexicographical order.
3. Count each possible reconstitution's maximized number of possible decoded strings. Make note of any ties.
4. Print the Kth candidate from the list of the top scoring uncorrupted encoded strings.
</strategy_steps>
<strategy_spec>
1. DP function `count_decoded_strings` for all characters *i through j*: bottoms up, works backwards with memoization (cache has initially `-1`). The encoded string can be split at every valid two-character substring: recurse and add to our current sum. Focus on this value until fully resolved.
2. Identify all possible inserted digits for the corrupted string, in lexicographic order.
3. For each potential reconstitution: propagate the counts from the DP function throughout.
4. Pick the Kth-best uncorrupted string and its largest number of possible decoded strings.
5. Use 64-bit math.

Your task is to decode a string that encodes lowercase letters using numbers where `1` stands for `A`, `26` stands for `Z`, and each number is between `1` and `26`. However, your string might have missing digits represented by `?`, and your goal is to maximize the number of possible decodings by filling in the `?` and then splitting it appropriately, while ensuring the resulting numbers fall within the `1-26` range.

You will need to get the lexicographically \(K\)th largest uncorrupted encoded string that achieves the maximum number of possible decodings. Then, output how many possible decodings such a string has, modulo \(998244353\).

#### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq T \leq 85\)
- \(1 \leq |E| \leq 100{,}000\)
- \(1 \leq K \leq 1{,}000{,}000\)
- The string \(E\) will only have digits and `?`
- \(K\) never exceeds the number of possible decodings for a uncorrupted string
- \(E\) always has at least one uncorrupted decoding
- Sum of \(|E|\) across all test cases does not exceed \(400{,}000\)

#### You are also given \(E\) and \(K\) for each test case.

#### Input Format:
- An integer \(T\)
- \(T\) lines, each containing \(E\) followed by \(K\)

#### Output per test:
- `Case #i: ` the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string fulfilling condition above, and count of decodings modulo \(998244353\)
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
You are provided with an encrypted string \(E\) that represents a message replaced with digits \(1-26\) corresponding to the letters \(A-Z\). This string \(E\) contains some missing digits represented by `?`. Your job is to determine an uncorrupted version of \(E\) that leads to the maximum possible decodings, and then find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest such string, followed by the count of these decodings modulo \(998244353\). 

For each test case, given encrypted string \(E\) and integer \(K\), you need to come up with the \(K\)th best uncorrupted string that allows for the most decodings while ensuring no leading zeros or invalid number ranges are used.

Besides \(E\) boundaries, other inferable conditions from sample scenarios:
- Leading zeros are invalid; thus, the string '01' cannot be split into '01' as a single part but '1' and '1', also '01' is an invalid number.
- Every digit in \(E\) is an integer \(1-9\) or the question mark (`?`).
- The maximum consideration will be taken to ensure \(K\) remains smaller than potential decodings a valid uncorrupted string might have.
- There's always at least one uncorrupted \(E\) that can be decoded into a valid message.

<constraint_analysis>
Given \(T\) test cases where each has a string \(E\) of length up to \(100{,}000\), and you must find a valid uncorrupted string fulfilling \(\geq 10^6\) query type, you must reduce the problem to an efficient permutation checking solution. 

With \(|E|\) up to \(100{,}000\), \(998{,}244{,}353\) modulo suggests an efficient dynamic programming approach for calculating decodings count. The upper bound \(\sum|E|\) \(400{,}000\) also points towards fairly straight forward computations per test case.

Ensuring this optimization helps:

- Dynamically calculate decodings count for all possible uncorrupted strings while sorting.
- Efficiently filter out leading zeros and non-1-26 numbers.
- Carefully chose a mapping strategy to maintain \(O(|E|)\) complexity.

Before moving forward with the solution, we need to outline what we're going to do in each case:
1. Perform DFS to explore all possible uncorrupted versions of the string.
2. Count the number of decodings per version, using a dynamic programming state to keep track of the number of ways to decode an ending substring.
3. Maintain the lexicographically largest K valid strings.
4. To count decodings for each version, we will start from each point and count how many ways we can decode the rest of the string properly.

Output the Kth largest uncorrupted string among such candidates and the decoded string count modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We're tasked with handling each string introduced, substituting `?` with digits, and then decode strings into characters (encoded as digits) into letters. We must selectively repair the input string with digits in such a way that the resulting string maximizes the count of distinct decodings. If there are multiple such strings, we return the Kth lexicographically largest. The number of distinct decodings for each valid uncorrupted string will be determined and calculated in a given mathematical modulus.

The problem revolves around finding the lexicographically \(K\)th-largest unique uncorrupted string that maximizes the number of decode possibilities. A dynamic programming solution works by maintaining \(dp\) arrays to store counts of digit sequences. Due to question marks and space for multiple-digit interpretations, recognizing opportunities for 1-digit and 2-digit interpretations besides tracking counts optimally leads to maximum decode counts.

We will utilize dynamic programming to efficiently traverse and consider every possible scenario recursively moving forward and storing the count of numbers decoded appropriately as per input context:

1. We generalize all `?` places as flexible and find maximum count scenarios.
2. We trim the strings to valid possibilities with the highest decode count.
3. We manage the conversion of these into readable strings, mapping back counts.
4. Efficiently select lexicographically \(K\)th positions within highest count groupings.

### Algorithm Explanation
1. **Count Decoding Options:** Use Dynamic Programming to count the number of ways to decode each sub-string.
2. **Identify 1st Max String (Base Case):** Use a simple DP again, but fix the first character to 1 and count the uncorrupted strings.
3. **Increment Count:** For each of the corrupted spots, count the strings if the first character is 2. Compare the counts with base and decay accordingly.
4. **Collect Valid Strings (Max String):** Collect the valid strings until the final string has been reached.
5. **Report Result:** Output the specific string from the valid strings and max count.
6. **Determine Index:** Handle the lexicographical number and get the final answer.

### Implementation

The implementation starts by pre-processing to store or compute the results of smaller strings that form parts of the string, next to figure out the best possible uncorrupted string with the maximum possible decoding. Lastly, it finds the exact $K$th string from these valid strings.

    int c = (isdigit(s[i - 1]) ? s[i - 1] - '0' : 0);
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * (!c || c < 7 ? 9 : 8));
    dp[i] %= MOD;
    dp[i] += ((un[i - 2] * (isdigit(s[i - 2]) && ((s[i - 2] - '0') * 10 + c) <= 26)) % MOD) * (c >= 1 && c <= 6) * 9;

Let `dp[i][n_followups]` be the number of followups for a prefix ending in position `i` with `n_followups`.

So for any `dp[i][n_followups]>0`, `dp[i+1][2*m] += dp[i][m]` if the next character is a 1 or a ?, and `dp[i+1][m-1] += dp[i][m]` if the next character is a 0-2.

We'll have `dp[|E|][0] = 1` and the answer will be `dp[0][target]` where `target` is the largest value of `dp[0][...]`.

Once we have the encoding that gives the most decodings, then we can use backtracking to find the lexicographically \(K\)th string that leads to it, by keeping a sorted list of the `?` we can place as `1`s or `2`s while we're parsing the string forwards, and then backtracking backwards (and erasing each used `1` or `2` each time we backtrack).

The following problem involves dynamic programming that efficiently handles both the generation of uncorrupted strings and the counting of decodings.

Let's break the problem down:

- Form an array to store the count of ways to decode up to each position in the input string (and its possible uncorrupted versions).
- If a character is a digit between `1` and `9`, it can stand alone as a valid code.
- If two digits are both less than `27`, they can be treated jointly as a valid code.
- For `?` symbols, consider all ten digits, counting all valid decoding configurations for each letter position in the uncorrupted string.
- Track the possible lexicographical maxima as we progress through the string, maintaining only the necessary elements for efficiency.

The challenge in implementing this lies in efficiently generating the possible decodings and identifying the \(K\)th lexicographically largest while maintaining result validity.

**Recursive Partition Generation:**
Given a string broken into segments, consider all valid ways to split the string into numbers from \(1\) to \(26\). On letter \(i\), if it's a single digit or not leading to \(0\), you can split between \(i\) and \(i+1\). Use a recursive solution with memoization to prevent recounting work, and trim leading \(0\) cases.

**Optimizing Question Mark Choices:**
Spell out the condition carefully. We only need to compute leading \(1\)s or \(2\)s after question marks if \(K\) is very large. Otherwise, try filling `?` with larger digits first then fall onto the lower walking branches of the search tree if \(K\) is smaller to find the best choices.

**Counting Decodings:**
A segment of length \(n\) has \(f(n)\) decodings when broken into valid segments. \(f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)\), assuming a lead in either one or two places gives any segment \(n > 1\) another "last bit" option. Base case \(f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2\) if it starts with a \(1\), as it can't start with a \(0\). To find \(K\)th string, proceed left to right and carefully decide whether to place a `1` or `2` to maximize branches splitting off.

Our approach involves creating a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of decoded strings for any given uncorrupted version of the input string. Then we identify all strings yielding the max number of decoded strings, sorting them lexicographically, and finding the \(K\)th one.

Let \(\text{dp}[i]\) be the number of ways to decode a substring starting at position \(i\) of the given string $E$. We process the string backwards since replacements made by "?":

- If the current character isn’t "?", we check if the substring $E[i:i+1]$ or $E[i:i+2]$ are valid characters (i.e., from 1-26).
- If the current character is "?", we consider all 10 possibilities of the digit it could represent.
- If both ($i+1$) and ($i+2$) positions can form a valid 2-digit number (10-26), we should generalize the states for all values "? can take in such positions.
- The final dp state is grounded upon how many ways can remnants of string be arranged from end (considering leading zeros, so it’s crucial all dp moves end strictly at "|E|").
- For determining final strings that achieve the highest count of decoded strings, an additional run of similar logic, but with recording palatable strings while retaining track of most common ones.

Given a string of digits, possibly containing question marks, representing a substitution cipher, one task is to decode it. Question marks must be replaced with appropriate digits to maximize the number of possible decoded strings. The string has to be organized into substrings corresponding to a 1-26 letter mapping. After determining the most decodable option, you then locate the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string among all options that give the maximum number of decoded possibilities. The number of decoded strings is given modulo 998244353.
</paraphrased>

<constraint_analysis>
The maximum length of the string in a single test is 100,000. Given that there are up to 85 test cases, it would be prohibitive to check all possible partitions of the string, which would take exponential time, given there are many partitions of the string.
</constraint_analysis>

In the given problem, you have a string $S$ that consists of digits and question marks, where question marks represent uncertain digit positions. Your goal is to replace each question mark with a digit to form a valid encoded string with the maximum number of possible decodings. Each valid encoded string must be split into substrings where each substring represents a letter between 'A' and 'Z', i.e., each substring is between 1 and 26.

Key Observations:
1. Each question mark `$?` can represent any digit from `1` to `9`.
2. Given the objective of maximizing possible decoded strings, each '?' implies two scenarios:
   - Being a single-digit or part of a possible two-digit substring
   - A '?' being part of two consecutive digits can imply multiple values (e.g., in `?5?`, `?` can imply `1,2,3...` with correct boundaries)
   
We must evaluate how many ways each part of the string can be decoded, treating '?' in different positions as "if-else" situations without fully enumerating all possibilities.

The best approach seems to be:
1. Calculate the biggest number of possible decodings for any given, correctly placed '?' replacements.
2. For the lexicographically K-th string, working backwards from the arrangement with the highest number of possibilities. This necessitates counting the combinations while tracking lexicographic order.

We consider:
- Representing the string as a series with possible splits represented as intervals

To outline the detailed approach:
1. **Calculate Possibilities for Non-Ternary Strings:** Directly count possibilities where '?'s do not lead to multi-digit scenarios.
2. **Consider Fixed Points:** Replace '?' with "1", optimizing all possibilities that a given '?' contributes to.
3. **Optimize with Dynamic Programming (DP):** Use DP to calculate maximum possibilities, and given this count, track each (string, resulting read order) combination for the K-th largest.
4. **Lexicographical Ordering:** Ensure the string, considering the question marks' replacement places it correctly in a lexicographic sequence.

- 目标是找到一个能够被解码成字符串数量最多的未损坏编码字符串，并返回这个字符串数量最大值。
- 如果有多个这样的字符串，返回它们中的第K个最大的。
- 输出字符串的数量用998,244,353取模。

# 问题分析

对于给定的加密字符串 \(E\)，可以将 `?` 替换为任意数字来确定解码路径数量。不同的替换方式会导致不同的解码路径数量。我们可以利用动态规划和广度优先搜索来解决此问题。

步骤如下：
1. 找到所有可能的未损坏字符串，以及它们对应的字符串数量。
2. 维护一个列表，记录最大解码路径数量及其对应的字符串。
3. 在这些字符串中找到第K个最大的字符串。

# 实现思路

- 遍历字符串 \(E\)，对于每个 `?` 字符，尝试替换为1到9，绕过可能导致前导零的0。
- 使用动态规划和广度优先搜索计算可以解码成多少种字符串。
- 这些字符串解码数量可能相同，选择较大的替换方案。
- 最后找到第K个解码路径最大值的字串。

# 结论
这种策略确保正确计算未损坏编码字符串的解码路径最大数量，同时确定第K个最大解码路径对应的字串。

[Solution Overview] 
1. Convert '?' into digits to maximize the answer.
2. Maintain a vector of candidate encoded strings in lexicographic order. Compare two encoded strings at the same position and lex-ordered if they are not equal.
3. Track the number of possible splits for candidates with dynamic programming:
4. For each i, for each k in the range i to i + 2:
- Count the ways to split to a substring of length k where:
  - The substr is 1-26
  - Both substr and next substring are 1-26
  - The substring is a prefix of 26>
5. The states are simplified by leaving out the starting indices of second substrings to simplify comparison.
6. Finally, we perform a multiset operation to merge non-overlapping ranges and output the Kth largest candidate.

The principal idea of this solution hinges on figuring out the maximum number of decodings. The actual effectiveness of decoding is solely dependent on the split points.

If a string has no question marks, it can be split in the most straightforward way (each possible slice of length 1-2 to form valid numbers).

Given question marks, they can be treated as either a single digit separate in a string on their left-hand side or doubled to form values towards the end of a string.

Conversely, any other question marks will be assumed as a doubled sequence. 

To then find the lexicographically \(K\)th-most, we must leverage Binomial coefficients, which can be precomputed efficiently.

We solve the problem in two layers:
1. Calculate the best splits.
2. Second, pinpoint the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string and apply the mod \(998{,}244{,}353\) to your result for this number of decodings.

The answer doesn't depend on the position of the uncorrupted digits.

The input string size is up to \(100,000\) and \(K\) does not exceed \(1{,}000{,}000\), which makes it impossible to iterate over all possible uncorrupted strings.

The strategy is to approach each case and try every possible uncorrupted string by replacing each occurrence of `?` with a digit from 1 to 9, taking care to avoid leading zeros and invalid numbers like '01', '02', etc. For each uncorrupted string, count the total number of valid ways it can be decoded using variations of dynamic programming. Specifically, we can consider fixing each `?` to different digits and calculating the results for suffixes of the string. 

After exploring all possibilities, we will identify the lexicographically largest uncorrupted string out of the ones with the maximum number of possible decoded strings. Finally, we print the lexicographically \(K\)th such string and the maximum number of possible decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

# Relaxed Analysis

Let us construct the sequence of characters that maximizes decodings, followed by the K-th largest among those. Start from the second to last position and move leftwards. Each `?` digit will give two possible decodings if it can be `1` or `2`. We only need to consider the number of possible decodings of the substring that remains to the right.

Denoting the maximum number of decodings of a string $S = DP[S]$, the following relations exist.
- $DP[$"`"$\verb|'$"|b] = 1$, $0 \le b \le 9$
- $DP[$"`'$"`0'$\verb|'|b] = 0$, $0 \le b \le 9$
- $DP[$"`'$"`1'$\verb|'|b] = 1 + DP[$"`'$\verb|'|b]$, $0 \le b \le 9$
- $DP[$"`'$"`2'$\verb|'|b] = 1 + DP[$`'$\verb|'|b]$, $0 \le b \le 6$
- $DP[$`'$\verb|'|b] = 0$, $b \ge 7$

Now the base case is obvious. Fill in the rest of the table working leftwards. The value of $DP[$`'?'$\verb|'|b] = 2 * DP[$`'$\verb|'|b]$, for each possible value of $b$. Hence we will only need to count all possible subsequences which give the highest number of combinations.

Now, we iterate each `?` left-to-right, and our `dp` on-the-go. Given an iterator $i$ with current string $s$ and position $i$, if $i < s.size() - 1$, append $b$ to $s$, and we need to append `0` to `9`, `10` to `19`, `20` to `25`, `999 ...` correspondingly, and associate each of those appended result in a sorted list. The result is the $K$-th sorted string. Notice the counting is computationally intensive hence we should use modular arithmetic: suppose we have $k$ groups of substrings, each group has distinct lengths $l_i$ and number of combinations $c_i$, the total number of combinations is $\prod c_i \ \text{mod} \ 998244353$.

To solve this problem, we'll utilize dynamic programming and combinatorics. The goal is to count the number of valid decodings for the uncorrupted input and match the requested \( K \)th lexical solution.

Our state in the DP will be \( dp[i][j] \), representing the number of distinct strings that can be formed using indices \( i \) to \( n-1 \) such that the last three digits form the number \( j \) expressed in base \( 3 \). If we denote \( 3^0 \) as the least significant base-3 digit, then 

- \( dp[i][0] \) represents a valid number \( j \),
- \( dp[i][1] \) represents an invalid number, and
- \( dp[i][2] \) represents a number of length \( 1 \) that needs the following number to make a valid encoding.

We initialize \( dp[n][0] = 1 \) and \( dp[i][j] = 0 \) for all other indices \( i \) and \( j \).

The ways to encode combinatorially is calculated as follows:
1. If a segment can end with a digit or as part of multi-digit number (1-2 digits).
2. For every "?" in sequence, treat all binary combinations as equal.

Using this, we derive values for \( dp \) and count permutations from cached data to find \( K \)th lexical solution.

For convenience and efficient calculations, use memory management and modular arithmetic.

We are provided with a corrupted encoded string $E$ that contains several question marks and digits. Each question mark has to be replaced with a digit as per the substitution rules. Consequently, we wish to generate an uncorrupted version of $E$ that has the maximum number of possible decodings into distinct strings, and then synthesize the Kth largest among all such uncorrupted versions. Additionally, we must compute the number of different ways the required uncorrupted version can be decoded, modulo $998244353$. 

From the backward end to the beginning of E, recursively consider each `?` and investigate the number of different decodings based on whether it represents `0`, `1`, `2`, etc. This process allows us to unravel the potential decodings systematically, leading to a dynamic and efficient approach to solving the problem. The uncorrupted versions with the highest possible decodings are prioritized, and the lexicographic order ensures that if several options have the same number of decodings, we can identify the correct sequence.

First, explore how we can replace the question marks in the encoded string to maximize the number of possible decodings. Note that encoded strings with question marks allow us flexibility in assigning values.

Assume `input_string` length is \(L\). We will do dynamic programming to find sub-optimal ways to decode starting from the end of the string. Use two-pointer approach to explore individual and possibly two-separated questions:

1. **Initialization**: If `K` exceeds the total possible decodings, output an error/maximum value.
2. **Explorations:** Process `input_string` moving backward, with each question mark replacing a value in terms of influences on the decoding count. Adjust based on rule violations and potential replacements.
3. **Result Calculation**: Once traversals give necessary splits, leverage pre-calculated binomial coefficient results modulo `998244353` to count valid splits.

Optionally, use `lexOrder` to maintain possibilities in descending order, merging valid decodings:

1. **Restore Counts Valid for `K`th Outcome**: Track contributions and ensure unique decoding count is preserved.
2. **Construct Answer Strings**: Build uncorrupted versions following rules of max splits.

Finally, validating `answerString` ensures it matches input constraints and correct number of decodings is achieved.

# DP on all possible substrings
The above observations require dynamic programming over all candidate substrings of the encoded string $E$, which keeps track of two arrays:
- `dp[i]` - the number of possible decoded representations for the subproblem $E[i:]$ with a valid split after `i`.
- `paths[i]` - an array of string to decode, or `null` if any valid character will do.

Initially, we initialize `dp` and `paths` for indexes starting at the corrupted indexes or markers, mainly `?`, but restart from any digit `0-9` as well. 

We iterate through the array `paths` by taking substrings of lengths such that the substrings map to a valid character. We link the `dp` and `paths` for these substrings to `dp[i`] following the validation conditions for valid substrings.

At the end, `dp[0]` should capture the solution we are looking for, which is the number of decodable strings. We re-trace paths similarly to follow to get the uncorrupted string lexicographically \(K\)th, and the value for all possible decoded strings modulo $998{,}244{,}353$ would need to be printed.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

<paraphrased>
Given a potentially corrupted encoded string $E$, with question marks representing unknown digits, the first goal is uncorrupt the string such that it has the most possible decodings. A string is decodable if every prefix can be mapped to a unique letter or a valid combination of letters under the classic substitution cipher. Each "prefix" can decode to a number between 1 and 26 (or up to 260 with leading zeros not allowed). A primary step involves looking at pairs of digits to see if they can potentially form valid decodings together. We need to find the uncorrupted strings that have the highest number of possible decodings, then output the lexicographically \(K\)th such string. 
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
- The maximum number of test cases is 85.
- The maximum length of string E is 100,000.
- The value of \(K\) is at most 1,000,000.
- The sum of lengths of E for all test cases is at most 400,000.

The problem handles reasonably large strings and a large value of \(K\), thus a dynamic programming state-based approach might be needed, with optimized iteration. In case of multiple valid strings (or decoding possibilities) with the same number of ways to decode, a lexicographic comparison must be maintained.
</constraint_analysis>
<observations>
- We need to first expand the encoded string in a way that maximizes the number of decodings.
- Since the question marks are wildcard characters, each one can be any digit (0-9), and need to be substituted such that the resulting decoded string is valid.
- We will initialize each question mark with the most number of feasible expansions first, typically `1` and `2` assuming they can be in the tens or units position respectively.
- Using Dynamic Programming (DP), we will keep track of the number of ways the string can be decoded at each step.
- To find the lexicographically \(K\)th uncorrupted string, we will recursively expand the first '?' to '0', then '1', and so on, checking the lexicographically minimal uncorrupted string at each step.
- We will keep a state matrix for dynamic programming to store the number of ways each prefix of the string can be decoded.
- We also need careful book-keeping for the possible ranges digits can take given the previous ones and constraints preventing leading zeros.
- It is important to accumulate the final answer modulo \(998244353\).
- To find the \(K\)th-uncorrupted, it's crucial to take into account the fact that some corrupted sequences (like `?5`) permit fewer decodings vs. `15` or `20`.

The approach is to initialize a DP array `dp[i]` that keeps track of the number of ways to decode the string from the start of the string to `i`. We treat pairs of digits as possible single numbers. A digit or '?' that stands alone optimally is 1 or 2, respectively. This is iterated over while supporting leading-zero restrictions. We must also apply correct replacements yielding the most decodes, lexicographically first.

- Process the string using the DP approach, with states transitions based on the next one or two characters.

Here’s how we can compute it:

Given a string Corruption that may contain digits or `?` characters, we aim to:

1. Replace `?`s with digits to find a valid string.
2. Using Dynamic Programming to Count Decodings:
   - \(dp[i]\): the number of ways to decode string until the \(i\) mark.
   - \(dp[0] = 1\) indicating an empty string can be decoded only in one way.

For a given index `i` (start from end), explore valid decodings within constraints `1 <= num <= 26` by checking one and two chars backward from index `i`.

\(final decoding = dp[n]\) (number of decodings possible in the entire string).

To address the lexicographically largest uncorrupted string, simulate the `n`th best way as follows:

- Start from the end of the string and mimic generating each character from the deciphered sequence.
- Avoid errors like leading zeros in multi-digit decode blocks. 

Since `dp` approach includes permutations from previously defined answers, each explores permutations that include previous successful count.

Restart aggregated \(max\) DP to `find Kth lex largest string` for valid dp[n] within `dp[i]` of maximum value.

Here’s how to implement the solution.

# Strategy

## Strategy

### Processing the string in reverse
To determine the maximum number of decodings and find the \( k \)-th largest uncorrupted string, we process the encoded string in reverse.

### Precomputing the number of decodings
For each possible suffix, we precompute the number of decodings by considering two states:
- \( T[i][k] \): the maximum number of decodings where the remaining input is a string of length \( i+1 \) and the second next digit is \( k \).

### Building a prefix tree
To facilitate the \( k \)-th largest uncorrupted string construction, we construct a prefix tree (trie) of all valid prefixes. For each prefix, we store two pointers:
- One pointing to the count-minimum total.
- Another pointing to the smallest total second step.

### Realistically, there are only 4 optimal prefixes for the second step of each encoding, being `1`, `2`, `0`, and `?`. The key idea is that for each prefix, the accumulated count and second step point update last each position in the string.

### Ensuring no leading zeros
Careful logic is required to ensure no leading zeros, failure cases, and separator points are appropriately managed.

### Implementation
We aim to implement the above logic, initializing the necessary arrays for dynamic programming and pre-computing tables, then building the prefix tree and determining the \( k \)-th uncorrupted string.

Given a string of digits and question marks, we need to uncorrupt the string so that it produces the largest possible number of valid decodings, and this should be done with respect to the lexicographical order. We aim to find the \(K\)th largest uncorrupted string which does so. This uncorrupted string might involve replacing '?' with '0', '1', or '2'. The challenge can be tackled using dynamic programming where we use the Fibonacci sequence for counting valid decodings, since each section can only be split into single-digit sections up to '26'.

To prepare for this, first count the '0's before any '2's, since they force an earlier split. Then, top-down DP calculates possible transformations into valid encoded strings, keeping count of each along the Fibonacci sequence, and bucketing them by the count. For returning the \(K\)th valid string, this solution maintains a pointer to reconstruct the sequence.

We start by initializing our DP array `dp[]` where `dp[i]` indicates the number of decodable ways for the substring from start to `i`. 

We loop over all characters of the string, updating the DP array considering each possible way to replace the `?`. For each position, we calculate the impact of replacing `?` as a `1` or `2`, considering the range.

At each step, we also keep track of the optimal replacement for the `?` to result in the most decodable ways for the entire substring. This requires a combination of recursive checks and best candidate tracking.

Finally, starting from the known best string, we systematically replace `?` to find the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string by skipping till we hit \(K\) sequences.

Encrypted string $E$ contains some digits and question marks. The task is to replace all question marks with digits such that when splitting the string into numbers, each number lies between $1$ and $26$. We aim to find the corruption that yields the maximum number of possible decoded strings. If there are multiple such strings, we are to find the $K$-th lexicographical one among them. Finally, output the number of possible decoded strings modulo $998,244,353$.

<h2>Constraints Analysis</h2>

- Large input size demands efficient algorithms (up to \(\mathcal{O}(|E|)\)).
- Since \(1 \leq K \leq 1,000,000\), we need to organize the answers efficiently for quick $K$-th element access.

<h2>Observations</h2>

<observation>
To maximize the number of possible decoded strings, we must ensure the number of ways to split the string into numbers of appropriate lengths. For consecutive `0` or `0?` strings, these induce errors and decrease the number of possible split ways.
</observation>

<observation>
Splitting each corrupted segment (`?`) into possible placements depends on the surrounding characters.
</observation>

<observation>
We can solve "incremental corruption" problems, which is placing digits in a way such that downstream splits are maximized.
</observation>

<observation>
The string must avoid invalid prefixes and invalid numeric chunks.
</observation>

<observation>
Instead of classical dynamic programming (DP), utilize binary search for the $K$-th lexicographical string.
</observation>

<h2>Solution</h2>

The solution leverages an array `dp` to count the numbers of ways to decode the string, and auxiliary arrays for caching results and backtracking optimal segments during restoration.

1. Replace all `?` with `0` to generate a valid string and initialize DP.
2. Use DP to efficiently compute possible letter splits.
3. For formatted string validation, ensure no prefixes or segments exceed a certain range.
4. Apply binary search and restoration function to find the $K$-th lexicographic string:
    - Search among valid splits to find the target $i$th corruption.
    - Determine the corruption by backtracking valid preceding splits.
    - Adjust the segment to retain validity while maintaining lexicographical order.

You have an encoded string of digits with question marks, representing potential missing information. Each question mark can be any digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to replace these question marks, split the digits into groups, and decode the string. You need to find the uncorrupted string with the greatest number of valid decoded permutations. Among these optimally decoded strings, you should output the \(K\)th largest one lexicographically. Additionally, compute and return the total count of these valid decoded strings modulo \(998,244,353\).

Each test case string \(E\) has a maximum length of \(100{,}000\). Given that there are up to \(85\) test cases, we must ensure the algorithm complexity is sublinear relative to the total characters (\(\sum|E| \leq 400{,}000\)). The value of \(K\) can be as large as \(1{,}000{,}000\), necessitating careful computation to avoid inefficiencies.

Furthermore, since we need to return the lexicographically \(K\)th largest permuted string and the total number of valid permutations modulo `998244353`, we have to manage the permutations efficiently.

The key is to manage the many permutations operation both quickly and correctly. This implies the need for a combination of combinatorial sequence generation (tracking potential permutations) and managing range constraints (within 1-26 digits).

This approach should optimize rather than compute all permutations, which is unfeasible with naive approaches in the order of 26! or higher.

Given that we have question marks, we need to replace them with actual digits while considering the multiple ways any sequence of digits can be split up, thus decoding to multiple strings. 

However, before diving into question marks, let's understand the valid splits a sequence can have. Each digit or sequence can be part of a continuous split, but it must fit within \(1\) and \(26\). It's essential to consider the combinatorial aspect of these splits: each split after the first can potentially start a new segment or continue an existing one. For any position in the string, we need to compute the number of valid splits starting there and track the maximum number of splits.

Dynamic Programming with a combinatorial twist can be used. We create a DP array where the \(i\)th index, \(dp[i]\), is defined as the number of valid ways to decode starting from the \(i\)th index. As we traverse the string, every character (or '?' repaired to a digit) updates the number of ways to decode that segment based on the preceding segment’s ways to decode.

Let’s set `?` to `1` by default for lexicographical order and calculate the total decodings starting from this configuration. Then, we sequentially attempt setting '2', and further digits until we find configurations where the total number of decodings equals the maximum found earlier. To ensure the \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) efficiency, we remove any leading zeros after each replacement decision and accept splits only if they stay within \(1-26\).

Given the constraint on \(K\) and final leading strings, a priority queue managed by a segment tree or a similar structure could be explored, but a straightforward approach with arrays supports taking the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string post-replacement efficiently.

It is slightly complex, but efficiency in dealing with \(K\) and only generating necessary splits and maintaining counts (with modulo operations) is achievable in \(\mathcal{O}(N + K)\) effectively,

- Given encoded string $E$ with question marks and digits

- Objective: Find uncorrupted string with maximum decoded strings
- Among strings with maximum decoded strings, output $K$-th lexicographically largest
- Output count of such decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\)
</paraphrasing>

To achieve the goal, we will follow these steps:
1. **Decoding Analysis:**
   - The string `META` encodes to `13 5 20 1`. Notice that decode is from `1` to `26`.
   - If a digit comes alone, it can be decoded to single digit.
   - If a digit comes as a pair, both should be between `1` to `26`.
   - There will always exist a valid corrupted digit replacement that leads to a valid clean encoded string.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each possible valid fragment with `A` digits:
     \[
     \text{Score} = \begin{cases}
           1 & \text{if } A = 2 \\
           3 & \text{if } A = 3 \\
           5 & \text{else}
         \end{cases}
     \]

3. **Optimal Strategy for $?`:**
   - Prioritize replacing `?`:
     - Prefix of constant length of at least 2.
     - Choosing values `1` or `2`; choose `1` unless there are enough `2` to make at least 26.
     - Least recent `2` (this ensures maximal strings).
     - If the value exceeded `26`, only `2` is valid; otherwise use `1` for most lexicographical order.
     - If remaining characters are all `?`, then use the subsequent `1` or `2` in sequence.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Formulate the array with decoded maximum frequency and track the lexicographically order.
   - Collect and output lexicographically \(K\)th largest string.

A series of optimizations can simplify the problem: Govern the "?” into either a single digit or a leading digit of a two-digit sequence. To analyze the maximum number of ways a string can be decoded, use dynamic programming on each encoded string, where `dp[i]` calculates the number of ways to decode the substring from start to the `i-th` character (inclusive).

Define `w[i]` as the optimal way to decode the substring from start to the `i-th` character. Maintain intermediate states to compensate for `10` to `26`.

For translating the highest numbered sequence, keep a running total and precompute the states for the highest-numbered possible sequence of a substring from 1st to K-th. This requires a multi-step DP where the output arrays are precomputed and stored.

Finally, reconstruct the optimal encoded string sequence by referring back to the configurations that lead to the maximal number of decoded strings, ensuring correct modulo calculations and careful state handling for bypassing leading-zero issues and `K`th valid sequence retrieval.

### Detailed Plan
1. Check initial constraints about leading zeros and parts within \(1-26\).
2. Use dynamic programming to generate all valid splits for a transformed E.
3. For each string transformation of E (from ?, 0-9):
   - Track splits from start to each character pos.
   - Invalidate transitions if part starts with zero or is out of range \(1-26\).
4. If a transformation results in maximum decodings, minimize with prefix sorting.
5. Determine if multiple max decodings, pick lexographically max \(K\)-th.

- Given an encoded string $E$ with question marks, find the uncorrupted string with the highest number of possible decoded strings, and return the lexicographically \(k\)th largest string
- Each number must be in between 1 and 26 inclusive
- Leading zeros in a number are invalid
- Each question mark can be replaced with a digit
- The string should be split into a series of numbers
- Here, k will never be larger than the number of strings having the maximum number of possible decoded strings
- We would output the number of strings a chosen uncorrupted string could decode to, mod $998,244,353$

1. Input Format:
   $$T (1 \leq T \leq 85)$$
   $$E (length of E \leq 100{,}000, contains digits and question marks)$$
   $$k (1 \leq k \leq 1{,}000{,}000)$$
2. Size and efficiency constraints:
   The maximum length of E is \(100{,}000\).
   The input string E may be variable length up to \(100,000\) characters.
   \(T\) is at most 85 per the problem constraints, so at most \(8500{,}000\) characters processed (not counting overflow'ing test cases).
3. Approach:
    - Replace `?` with the possible digits.
    - Generate possible splits of the string into valid character encodings.
    - Count the number of ways each uncorrupted string can result in decoded strings.
    - Use Dynamic Programming to calculate Fibonacci numbers to store the number of possible decoded strings for substrings.
    - Store and handle lexicographically greatest strings for maximum counts and return the \(k\)th greatest string among maximum counts.
4. Example:
    - For "?35?01", possible strings are `135201`, `135101`, `235101`, etc., leading to 2 `MECA`, `MECA`, `SKCA`, etc. `135201` has the highest count, `2`. Lexicographically 3rd is `122`, which has count 3.

2. Process:

   - For each uncorrupted string, count legal splits into valid letter encodings.
   - Use DP to store the number of ways each substring can be decoded.
   - For each maximum count, record the lexicographically \(k\)th-largest uncorrupted string.
3. Example:
   "?35?01" resolves to "135201", "135101", "235101", etc. "135201" has decodings like MECA, MECA, SKCA. Maximally decodable is "135201", count 2, 3rd lex = "122", count 3.

The task involves receiving an encoded string with some digits replaced by `?`. The goal is to decode it into digits 1-26, ensuring no leading zeros. We need to first determine the maximum number of possible decodings and then find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest uncorrupted string that achieves this maximum, both modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Decoding must proceed from right to left, prioritizing the rightmost '?' first to ensure the smallest numbers are assigned as needed. Each '?' can represent any digit \(0\) through \(9\). The objective is to maximize the number of possible decodings while satisfying the constraints.

Consider the following optimizations:
- Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to \(|E|^2\) modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) as the total number of ways can be represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers.
- Replace `?` with `0` initially and adjust according to constraints or Fibonacci sums if specific characters provide a larger number of valid decodings.

### Overview

We need to find an optimal way to replace the `?`s in sequence $E$ to maximize the number of ways the sequence can be split into valid letter codes. We'll use dynamic programming to store the maximal number of decode ways and build the optimal sequence. We use space efficient techniques and pruning to keep the solution's complexity under control. We also precompute relevant values to enable finding the $K$th largest sequence easily.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Encoding**: Calculate the maximum number of decodings for each prefix ending with a digit or `?` replaced by a digit.
2. **Tree Construction and Pruning**: Build a tree of optimal decodings, pruning paths deemed less optimal.
3. **Lexicographical Sorting**: Apply lexicographic sorting optimized with efficient computation to pick the $K$th largest string.
4. **Modulo Operator**: Remember to apply modulo \(998244353\) to required operations.

##### Implementation Observations:
- Use memoization to handle the exponential number of states under replacement & splits.
- Tree pruning reduces computation by not exploring suboptimal paths.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#define MOD (int)998244353

// Node representing the state of the tree
struct Node {
    int maxDecodeWays;
    char val;
    vector<Node> children;
    Node(char _val, int _ways): val(_val), maxDecodeWays(_ways) {}

    // Add a child with a single-character addition and corresponding decode ways
    Node* addChild(const char _val, const int _ways) {
        children.push_back(*new Node(_val, _ways));
        return &children.back();
    }

    // Helper function to calculate ways to split a candidate string
    int splitWays(const string& segment) {
        int ways = 1, ways2 = 0;
        int len = segment.size();
        // Differentiate 1-based and 2-digit additions
        for (int i = 1; i <= min(len, 2); i++) {
            if ((int(segment[0]) - '0') + ((i == 2) ? segment[1]*10 : 0) <= 26) {
                ways2 = (ways + (i == 2 ? ways : 0)) % MOD;
            } 
        }
        return ways2;
    }

    // Determine value at a specific depth and index if constructing that state in order
    char valueAt(const int depth, const int index) {
        if (index > 1) return children[index-2].valueAt(depth, index - 1);
        return val + (index == 1)*(children.size() > index ? children[0].val : 'A'-1);
    }
};

int ptKthString(Node* treeRoot, const int depth, const int tripPath, const int K) {
    if (tripPath == 0) {
        return treeRoot->valueAt(depth -

You are given an encoded string \( E \) representing digits between '0' and '9', and possibly several '?', denoting missing digits. Each '?' can be replaced with any digit from '0' to '9'. The goal is to replace the missing digits such that the resulting string can be split into valid combinations representing letters (1-26), and this valid string production is to be optimized.

After deriving all possible valid uncorrupted strings, the one(s) with the most possible decoded strings (given valid splits between 1-26) is (are) identified. If multiple such possible valid uncorrupted strings share the same maximum count of decoding possibilities, we output the \( K \)th lexicographically largest string. Additionally, we output the number of possible distinct decodings of this particular uncorrupted string modulo 998,244,353.

Understanding the problem involves:
- Handling `'?'`: To generate all original actual digits.
- Working with leading digit constraints: A '0' can only appear if overall string has more than one remaining part after it.
- Applying dynamic programming for maximizing decode counts: Instead of recursive enumeration, rely on a count as a function of length.

The following C++ snippet leverages above understanding. We're calculating number of decodings with DP and keeping trailing zeros path counts to 0, and finding \(k\) feasible replacement sequence.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

    string encodedStr;

int dp[100001][10]; // stores number of decodings till i with last digit being j
long long decodeCount(string& encodedStr) {
    int n = encodedStr.size();

    // Initializing dp array.
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) dp[0][i] = 0;

    // Fill dp array for each position.
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) dp[i][j] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            int num = (encodedStr[i - 1] == '?' ? j : encodedStr[i - 1] - '0');
            if (i > 1 && num == 0) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][0];
            else dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][num]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    return (dp[n][0] + dp[n][0] + dp[n][0] + dp[n][0] ) % MOD;

This problem requests replacing all question marks in string $E$ to yield an uncorrupted version with maximum decodability. Follow these steps in the answer:

1. Preprocess $E$, identifying segments where question marks could contribute digits influencing the total number of possible decodings.
   
2. Calculate the number of valid decodings for each identified segment via dynamic programming (DP). Specifically, for two consecutive digits $cd$, where both \(c\) and \(d\) are real digits or `"?"`, if $cd \leq 26$, $n_0$ equal to the value counted for $c$ if $cd = c$, and $n_2$ identical to the value associated with $d$ if $cd = d$, the value for $cd$ is `n_0 + n_2`.

3. To identify the maximum number of decodings, combine valid segments of $E$ into distinct uncorrupted strings and count the decodings for each. The string offering the highest count max_impressions = impressions_pc_max_pre_lap represents the answer.

4. To retrieve the $K^{th}$ lexicographically largest of those uncorrupted strings achieving the maximum number of decodings:

   1. Analyze $E$ to locate potential transition points signifying groups that maximize the number of resultant decodings with minimum space spent between digits.
   
   2. For each transition point, compute a bitmask indicating undecided positions (zones preceding each transition point).
   
   3. Identify all unique combinations of these bits (representing valid string replacements), then choose the \(K^{th}\) lexicographical string.

Combining all this, one can efficiently compute the desired result while handling the typical problem size. This leads to an algorithm that starts by parsing $E$, uses dynamic programming to count decodings, identifies the optimal replacement strategy, and selects the answer string by examining bitmasks of conditions.

```python
MOD = 998244353

dp_table = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(101)] # DP table

def count_decodings(encoded):
    n = len(encoded)
    dp, dp_next = [0] * 3, [0] * 3
    dp[0], dp[1], dp[2] = 1, int(encoded[0] != "0"), 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if encoded[i] == "?": dp_next[0] = (dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD
        if encoded[i-1] in "1?": dp_next[1] = dp[0] or dp[1]
        if encoded[i-1] in "2?" and encoded[i] in "012?": dp_next[1] = (dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD
        dp, dp_next = dp_next, dp
        dp_next = [0]*3 # Reset next row
    return dp[1]

To solve this problem, we need the following key observations:
1. **Uncorrupt the '?'** by replacing them with digits that make valid encoding and yield the maximum number of decodings. 
2. **Count Decodings** using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate how many ways the uncorrupted string can be decoded.
3. **Analyze Splitting Possibilities**: The number of possible decodings of an uncorrupted string may vary greatly with how the string is split into valid letter sequences.
4. **Greedy Approach**: Select the best possible "?" substitutions to maximize the number of decodings, and keep track of all best solutions, returning the \(K\)th largest.

We would use a deterministic approach to manage the splits and an attempt to maximize the number of decodings for each split scenario. We leverage dynamic programming for this to optimally compute the number of possible decodings for a valid sequence, and a combination of greedy logic for the string generation.

# Implementation
We simulate the replacement of each `?` followed by dynamic programming mechanism to find the maximum number of decodings possible. Keeping the top `K` highest count strings, we finally extract the requisite string and count.

We will approach this challenge through dynamic programming on substrings. We count and categorize segments based on their properties towards creating unique decodings:

1. Let \(dp[i][j]\) denote the number of ways to decode the substring \(E[i:j]\).

2. If a substring \(E[i:j]\) is uniform (all characters are digits), its value is straightforward to calculate.

3. For substrings with None, their value is the value of the remaining characters as no '?' is present. We iteratively build up the solutions from smaller substrings to larger ones.

4. From each segment, we will collect candidate strings by adding the best replacements for any ‘?’.

To find all possible uncorrupted strings, we will perform a separate pass to generate all uncorrupted variations and sort them lexicographically.

Finally, we consider the lexicographically $K$-th string amongst the ones with the highest count of decodings, our desired string.

For optimization:
- Using a suffix automaton can help efficiently navigate and choose lexicographically largest strings.
- Modulo $998{,}244{,}353$ applies to counts but doesn't affect the algorithm complexity.

Each segment's contribution is evaluated, and counts are aggregated. Efficient state transitions and updates are critical to achieving an optimal solution within the given constraints.

The first step is to set up a merging function that calculates the number of ways a string can be decoded when concatenated with another such string. This function makes use of dynamic programming to keep track of two key variables: `end`, which contains the decoding count for substrings ending in the last digit; and `end2`, the count for substrings ending in the previous two digits.

Next, when decoding the original string, we work backwards from its end. If a substring can be interpreted as starting with a '1' or a '2', we recursively compute the total decodings counting the branch created with a new '?' added at the front.

To achieve the \(K\)th lexicographically largest string, we maintain a priority queue (max-heap) sorted by string in reverse lexicographical order. The top of the heap will always be the largest lexicographical string. When exploring different branches, the heap is updated to contain all possible decodings that could represent the highest number of decoded configurations.

At the end, the heap always starts with the original uncorrupted string. As '?'s are substituted sequentially, we expand the heap with new strings that respect the constraints (primarily not starting with leading zeros). 

Once we've made our substitutions and explored all branches, our answer is the lexicographically \(K\)th item in the heap, along with the number of decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We are given a string of digits and question marks, and tasked with finding the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string that can decode into the maximum number of unique strings, by replacing the `?` with valid digits.

**Approach**:

Given the large input size, direct computation is not feasible.

1. Create a DP table where each entry represents the maximum number of decodable strings for a sub-problem.
2. Traverse the string from start to end, updating the DP table as you encounter each digit or question mark.
3. To handle `?`, utilize its flexibility to contribute multiplicatively to the current maximum possible count of decodings.
4. Track the lexicographically order of the results. Use a priority queue or similar to maintain the $K$ largest strings in optimal manner.
5. Compute the answers dynamically by taking advantage of previously computed solutions.
6. Finally, backtrack to reconstruct the Kth largest string under the above constraints, leveraging the DP table.

Given a corrupted encoded string \( E \) made up of digits and question marks, you need to replace the question marks with digits to form a valid encoded string that can be split into segments representing letters (from 1 to 26). The task is to find the lexicographically $K$-th largest uncorrupted string with the maximum number of possible decodings.

# Constraints
- \(1 \leq T \leq 85\)
- \(1 \leq |E| \leq 100{,}000\)
- \(1 \leq K \leq 1{,}000{,}000\)

# Strategic Approach
1. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - \(E\) is restricted to digits (0-9) and question marks.
   - \(K\) will always be within the range of maximum possible decodings.
   - There is always a valid uncorrupted string.

2. **Problem Breakdown**:
   - Goal to find the uncorrupted string with the maximum possible decodings.
   - Needs replacement of question marks.
   - Decode using the principle that each number between 1-26 represents a character.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Use DP to count valid splits from \(E\).
   - Calculate possible splits recursively: \(1\) or \(2\) characters at a time.

4. **Approach to Find Lexicographically Largest**:
   - Focus on finding the most likely splits that maximize decodings.
   - Ensuring a valid encoded string without leading zeros.
   - Iterate back from maximum decodable positions.

5. **Implementation Explanation**:
   - Use DP to calculate possible decodings for each segment.
   - Track the number of valid splits from the end.
   - For splitting, ensure no leading zeros.
   - Form the \(K\)-th largest string by a selected approach (DFS).

We first need to uncorrupt the string $E$ and find the string that has the largest number of possible decodings into valid segments. After uncorruption, we aim to generate strings with the maximal number of decodable states. We're particularly interested in the lexicographically $K$ largest string that satisfies this condition.

#### Step by Step:
1. **Replacements for Question Marks**: For each question mark, replace it with digits that do not lead to invalid segments. The best option would be `1` first, then `2` (since `2` allows building two-digit numbers like `12`, `21`).
2. **Dynamic Programming Table (DP)**: Use a DP table such that $dp[i]$ is the number of ways to validly decode the first $i$ characters of the string.
3. **One-Digit and Two-Digit Segment Checking**: For a digit string of length $i$, if it can be split to $j$ and $i - j$, the state is updated as $dp[i] = (dp[i-j] + dp[i-1]) \mod MOD$, where MOD = $998{,}244{,}353$.
4. **Lexicographical String**: Maintain a lexicographical order while maximizing the number of decodings. Replace `?` starting with `1` and then `2`.
5. **Specific Position $K$ Search**: Given $K$, find all possible maximal number decoding strings and then find the specific $K$th largest string.

```cpp
struct StringDecoding {
  static constexpr int MOD = 998244353;

  // Checks whether a string up to pos can decode to multiple possibilities
  int potentialMaxDecodings(string corrupt, int pos) {
    vector<int> dp(pos+1,0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    int len = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= pos; i++) {
      if (len == 0 || i == pos)
        dp[i] = dp[i-1];

        corrupt[i] = safeDigit(corrupt, len, i);
      len = corrupt[i-(i-1)] == '0' || corrupt[i-(i-1)] == '9' ? 0 : len+1;

For each malformed encoded string, we need to evaluate various replacement scenarios. This will involve dynamic programming:

1. Let’s consider a dynamic programming scheme where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of possible decoded strings given the substring `E[i:]` and the last digit decoded is `j` (0 if this does not apply).
2. Looping backwards helps simplify achieving the K-th case lexicographically. We infer the next digit choice. This is especially beneficial when some digits are corrupt where several options are available.
3. After dynamically computing to get the overall maximum number of possible decoded strings for a specific uncorrupted E, we backtrack or directly compute the \(K\)-th lexicographical string.

One consideration involves segmenting not just `2`-digit segments but `1`-digit ones when it helps stay within 1..26. We target breaking out `2`-digit segments whenever possible, helping maximize, and ensuring initial digits favor smaller choices for lex order.

Given a string like `1?0`, we can replace the `?` with any digit, but the resulting string has to be split into valid substrings.

The key insight is to understand the number of ways a string can be decoded. A valid split point is one where the substring before it is between `1` and `26`. Thus, the number of valid ways is the product of combinations of splits.

Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the string starting from position `i`. Initially, `dp[N] = 1` (basecase), and transitions fill out `dp[i]` from the end of the string and work backwards towards `i = 0`.

Let each vector `dp[i]` be computed based on the valid splits from `i` to the end. We maintain a segment tree (or similar data structure) to efficiently sum over ranges that would correspond to valid splits.

If a substring contains a `?`, it complicates since each `?` can take any digit. Thus, we utilize DFS to back-track through possibilities, ensuring consistency. By recognizing the patterns that emerge based on the position of `?`, the segments can lead us to the overall maximum number of decoded outputs and lexicographical order.

Finally, after determining the maximum number of decodings, we can use a priority queue or similar to output the \(K\)th largest solution.

The additive nature of the problem means dynamic programming can be used to achieve \(O(|E|)\) time complexity for each potential string.
</observation>
<observation>
To find precisely \(K\)th largest, beginning at the smallest, we iterate through all possible strings sorted, in lexicographic order, to avoid visiting non-possible strings early.
</observation>
<observation>
This can be further optimized by only considering strings that aren’t easily too small. That is, we do accept, for example, strings ending with a one. But we would ignore ones like `445`. This can be implemented with strings being processed based on the character `?` present. We begin from the string that simply replaces them with `1` and step up from there.
</observation>
<observation>
To compute the final answer, we need to know the number of splits for each string. This can be achieved by dynamic programming specifically to build a table of splits for each prefix of strings, where the value at each stage depends on the value from the prior character.
</observation>
<observation>
To get the maximum answer and the \(K\)th best, one can maintain a table with the optimal answer until now and the best strings based on the simple state transitions.

<observation>
We cache the number of splits that result from a string, to avoid recomputing results.

We can start with a naive observation that validating a string is actually a dynamic programming problem. Meaning, whether a stripped string can be sourced down from a valid encoded strip will be equal to a sum of all the possible valid source strings that can add up to it.

After getting that into place, the rest will be about memoization and a DFS approach to sequence generation to gather potential strings and eventually sort the vectors to locate the Kth largest string.

**Dynamic programming Idea:** We can represent each substring resulting from replacing `?` with `1` to `9` as a state. Each state transition is to a next substring, which indicates that the character can contribute to the next following number or not depending on the value.

After having all possible strings that have the most ways of being decoded, the rest of the challenge is simple comparing lexico order.

Dynamic programming can be used to determine a maximum configuration. The trick is to backtrack from the end (or future, in your terms) while recognizing each valid split. Recursively compute the number of decodings for \(E\) by considering whether the part can be interpreted as \(1\) or \(2\) one decodable numbers (when valid), and process it accordingly.

Given a stack representing \(E\), if the top elements can form a properly formatted prefix (considering for cases of question marks leading to different splits like "1?"), we recurse with suffixes of \(E\) in different possible trimmed states (subtract these cases from stack as you compute).

How do we ensure lexicographic \(K\)-th order? Construct a map of string.decoding_counts pairs. Once all recursive calls are made (with counts for each string), sort by lexicographic order and pull from remaindered one.

Given the constraints, preprocess all possible replacements and iterations might be costly. Thus, string slicing involving amortized \(O(1)\) retrieval will enable efficient recursion.

In a string encoded using a substitution cipher involving question marks for corrupted digits, the goal is to reconstruct the string by replacing the question marks and then determining the maximum number of ways the string can be decoded into different sequences.

The requirement to store and process up to \(10^6\) decoded strings imposes strict bounds on the efficiency of our approach.*

The solution involves identifying all possible ways one can decode the string with replaced '?' digits and grouping these ways by their corresponding reconstructed strings. The "decode" function returns pairs of strings and the number of ways they can decode. We handle cases like leading zeros and valid (1-26) numbers for substrings separately.

To find the lexicographically \(K\)th-largest encoded string, we first generate all such strings by backtracking and iterating over all "?" and replacing them. We then collect valid encoded strings and their decode counts; sort them lexicographically, and select the \(K\)th-largest. To ensure efficient processing for large input sizes, we precompute and use dynamic programming for decoding counts and handle filtering preemptively.

The samples illustrate how thoroughly we need to consider all segmentations of the "?" in terms of valid ASCII sequences and compute how many distinct decodings they provide. Then, leveraging the maximum from these computations to order and pinpoint our output.

To solve this problem, we need to handle the replacement of each `?` with a digit and compute the number of decodable strings for each possible assignment.

Steps:
1. Iterate over all valid placements of digits for each `?`.
2. For each placement, check if the resulting string is valid by ensuring no digit starts with '0'.
3. Backtrack to find all valid decodings of the formed string.
4. Collect the decodings for each corrupted string replacement.
5. Sort and select the \(K\)th highest uncorrupted string based on the counts of possible decodings.
6. Calculate the number of decodings modulo \(998,244,353\).

Define an array `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the substring `[i]` till `end` of the string. Note that leading zeros are not allowed, and numbers cannot be larger than `26`.

Initially, we set up a few checklist values to ensure numbers don't start with zero and don't exceed `26`.

To initialize `dp`, denote `dp[|S|] = 1` where `|S|` represents the total length of the string noting as single number accommodation. This means no residual corruption after end of the string. 

The recurrence relation will be as follows:
- **If `S[i]` is not a `?`:**
  - `dp[i] <- dp[i + 1]+ if( i+2 < |S| && S[i+2] != '0' && "00" <= (String containing the number from i to i + 2) < "27" ) then dp[i + 2] else 0`
- **If `S[i]` is `?`:**
  - Iteratively try replacing '?' with digits `1` to `9` and add up the valid segment's dp value towards this index `i`.

Via backtracking, construct all possible resulting encoded strings. For every encoded string, evaluate the string to check whether it inevitably leads to a decoded string with maximum count. If there are multiple such strings, erase bigger ones to find the \(K\)th smallest lexicographically largest string.

# Implementation

```python
from collections import defaultdict
MOD = 998244353  # Good idea to define a constant for our modulo here.

def decode_count(s):
    # Define the dp table initialized with 0's
    dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)
    dp[len(s)] = 1

    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '?':
            dp[i] = 9 * dp[i + 1] % MOD
            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i + 2] not in '0789':

Given a string \(E\) with digits and question marks, the goal is to replace '?' with digits, split \(E\) into substrings representing valid letter codes between 1 and 26, and identify the uncorrupted version that has the maximum number of valid decoded versions. We need to find the \(K\)th lexicographically largest of these uncorrupted strings and count its decodings. The output consists of this string and the decodings count modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
The length of \(E\) can be up to \(10^5\). Therefore, efficient algorithms will be required to manage time complexity, particularly for large strings and large \(K\).

In-depth analysis:
1. The maximum length of \(E\) across all test cases aggregated is \(400{,}000\).
2. \(K\) must never exceed the total number of optimal uncorrupted strings.
3. The string can handle both digits and '?' characters.
4. We need to implement a solution that combines dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics.

</observations>
To solve the problem:
1. Identify possible splits in the uncorrupted string.
2. Replace each '?' as required.
3. Calculate all valid splittings using dynamic programming.
4. Track optimal strings by maximum decodings.

The task requires the use of dynamic programming with an efficient calculation method based on substrings valid splits.

To count valid splits, use a recursive function \(dp(L, R)\) which calculates the number of valid splits in the substring from \(L\) to \(R\). Optimize this with memoization.

Given \(E\), tackle '?' by:
- Leaving it unchanged.
- Replacing '?' with each digit from `0` to `9`.

Keep records of optimum splits’ frequency and track top-\(K\) strings lexico order.

Given a string containing digits and question marks, decode by replacing question marks. Each restored string can be split into numbers between 1 and 26 to form decodings. The task is to find the uncorrupted string version that allows the most possible decodings, outputting its lexicographically Kth largest form and number of decodings modulo $998,244,353$.
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
The sum of lengths of \(E\) across all test cases is at most \(400{,}000\): Almost linear time is okay, but \(O(len(E)^2)\) is too slow.

The number of decodings is slow: \(\mathcal{O(1)}\) per string is required, thus we calculate a score for each position instead of decoding into strings. Efficient score calculation \(\mathcal{O(1)}\) is necessary to make character calculations quick.

When we work on dynamic programming of this nature, we assign a score to each position based on configurations leading to maximum decodings.

If \(E_i\) is('?') and \(E_{i-1}\in \{1,2\}\), then the '?' can make a one character pair or a two character. The condition is \(E_{i-1} \times 10 + E_i \leq 26\).

Each DP value relies on the previously calculated ones. Initially, a string like "111" has 1 way to decode. A string "?" can be decoded as, at minimum, a 1. But if '?' can pair with the previous digit to make a digit in the range 10 to 26 (with the tens digit being non-zero), it can introduce more decodings. 

This DP involves score computation and lexicographic comparison to find the Kth largest string. The DP might need numerous iterations and character comparisons to optimally recreate the string with maximum score.

Let's preprocess the largest decode number of each '?' character position.

Let $$\text{DECODINGS(i, j)}$$ be the value of decode number of $$E[i \dots j]$$.

We can set a recursive relation $$\text{DECODINGS(i, j)} = \text{DECODINGS(i+1, j-1)} + \cdots \text{you try i to j-1, j to j-1, \dots, j-1 to j-1} \cdots$$.

We can either set up a dynamic programming table or calculate on the fly.

It helps to make the following calculation precomputed. For a query on the state of string E, define the sequence $$A_i = \text{DECODINGS(i, i)} + ... + \text{DECODINGS(i,i+1)} + ...$$, and note that this sequence has an overlay pattern that can speed things up.

Considering the sample input E = `?35?01`:

Prefixes of E: `?35?01`
Calculations:
```
A_0 = 0
A_1 = 0 + 1 = 1
A_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
A_3 = 4 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 20
A_4 = 20 + 20 + 20 + 12 + 3 = 75
A_5 = 75 + 10 + 12 + 4 + 1 = 102
A_6 = 102 + 3 = 105
```

We notice that A_2 through A_5 share the entries 4 and 20 meaning that decoding of fragments `35` and `5?01` have the same calculation except for the first and the final.

So we remember a repeated pattern of values, and notice that any such pattern with infinite repetitions will reduce to the sum-of-first-n-values of that pattern.

Once we know all possible decode numbers for each index of `?`, it is just a matter of the lexicographically \(K\)th smallest index with maximum value.

We can use binary search on the maximum value to identify the Kth index if T < 1000,000 (Note that index is 0-based and we need to adjust during output). If T > 1000,000, then follow the logic of re-writing prefix sum pattern calc.

Given an encoded string with possible corrupted (?), we need to deal with three operation:
(1) Compute the number of possible decodings of an encoded string with current encoding deterministically, 
(2) Get lexicographically \(K\)th largest of all possible decodings given encoding, and 
(3) Update encoding by replacing all '?' in a lexicographic order.

To compute (1), note that if a block only has length \(1\), then it can only be decoded as one letter and we multiply the count of previous result by \(1\). If the block has length \(2\), determine which way it could be decoded by checking if it's a valid one letter (two digit number between \(10\) and \(26\)) or a valid two letters (two single digit numbers: one-letter in total from \(1\) to \(9\) and second letter anything) and update the count.

To compute (2), note that given an encoding, we can just generate all possible decodings and sort them lexicographically.

To compute (3), replace '?' with '0' (smallest possible digit) and incrementally follow these steps as needed to maintain lexicographic order.

To solve the problem:

1. **Count Maximum Decodings**: For an encoded string, we aim to replace each '?' in all possible ways and count the number of valid decodings for each possible replacement. Use dynamic programming, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the string starting from position `i`.
 
2. **Generate Lexicographically K-th String**: Instead of directly seeking the lexicographically K-th string, simulate all possible replacements for question marks, generate all lexicographic strings derived from those replacements, and sort them to find the K-th largest. This avoids the complexity of DFS for scanning each possible string during runtime.

3. **Construct Valid Strings**: For every '?' character, replace it with the smallest possible digit initially (minimize left to right) to count decodings. Remember to reverse the string before replacement for lexicographic ordering.

In order to optimize the number of valid strings, we explore potential ways to partition the string into valid numbers. Care needs to be taken to avoid leading zeros and ensure all segments are numbers that don't exceed 26. We then recursively solve the problem for substrings and maintain counts and strings leading to the maximum splits.

Here is a solution that addresses the outlined queries, coherent with the desirable patterns for partitioning into numbers:

    if s in memo:

    for offset in range(1, 3):
        next_char = s[:offset]

        if '0' not in next_char and 1 <= int(next_char) <= 26:
            # Try the next part after the current offset
            remaining = s[offset:]
            count, second_best = count_and_determine(remaining, k, memo) 

            # Out of the best ways, we may combine with this to be the best if no '?'

                continue

            # Determine the overall best string
            if second_best > count:
                valid_ways, best_str = count, next_char + second_best
            else:
                valid_ways += count

            k -= 1

To solve this problem:

Consider building the uncorrupted string back-to-front. At each step, look at the two next characters either to be decoded or already filled in. If these two characters constitute a valid character (either two digits forming a one or two-digit number between `1` and `26`, or one digit and a `?` forming a valid character), try that. Otherwise, make the character `1`. 

To maintain lexicographic order, always try making the character `1` first and then `2`, and then update \(K\). Since the order of characters is crucial, managing `K`'s updates to reflect the maximum number of decode paths is necessary.

For each step, evaluate with dynamic programming (or greedy if viewed from front-to-back with memoization) the maximum number of decode paths possible with valid characters either `1` to `9` or `12` to `26`. Once the string is constructed, just remember to ensure no leading zeros appear, and every substring forms a valid character.

By tracking the maximum number of decode paths possible for each valid way, and the corresponding decodable uncorrupted string, we can efficiently determine which uncoded string is the \(K\)th.

# Bellman-Ford
With the dynamic programming table \(dp[index][count]\) established where \(dp[index][count]\) represents the number of ways to decode string end at \(index\) starting from 1 to \(index\) with \(count\) ways, we initialize the array and progressively evaluate count ways for each substring and its characters.
We fill \(dp\) and backtrack to get the maximizing string. To achieve inspection efficiency (for the best in lexicographical order), we use a sorting or heap-based approach.

The problem requires understanding the different ways to decode each possible uncorrupted string, along with using dynamic programming to calculate these decodings efficiently, and maintaining a lookup for strings and their decodings' count. We sort uncorrupted strings lexicographically when needed and extract the required one. 

To summarize the algorithm:
1. Replace the `?`s in multiple ways until obtaining strings that are potentially valid and sortable.
2. Ensure no leading zeros in valid encoded strings.
3. Update the number of decodings based on valid chunks.
4. Use a priority queue to find the largest uncorrupted strings efficiently.

# Implementation

The following code demonstrates a solution where questions are replaced with digits and valid encoded strings are counted using dynamic programming. A breadth-first search explores a string's permutations, storing all possibilities until the optimal number of decodings is found. A priority queue then retrieves the lexicographically \(K\)th valid string.

The task is to find the \(K\)th-largest encoded string from uncorrupting a given corrupted encoded string \(E\) such that the string, when split, yields the maximum possible number of different decodings. Let's outline the core algorithm:

1. **Define the decoding count**: The count function for a section of the encoded string can be defined recursively. If the length of the encoded string is \(i\) and the \(i\)th character is a digit, the count is equal to the sum of counts for the string ending at \(i-1\) and \(i-2\), if \(i-2 \ge 0\) and the number represented by the substring from \(i-2\) to \(i\) is between 1 and 26. If the \(i\)th character is a `?`, it introduces some complexity.

2. **Dynamic Programming to handle `?`s**: Replace each `?` with all possible digits from 0 to 9 and calculate the count. We need to keep track of the number of decodings from the start of the string to each position for all possible replacements of question marks. We use dynamic programming (DP) to calculate that efficiently.

3. **Determine the \(K\)th-largest encoded string**: To find the \(K\)th largest uncorrupted encoded string, we generate all potential encoded strings from the original string while converting each `?` to digits from 0 to 9. Each of these strings has an associated valid decoded count.

4. **Output the best \(K\)th-largest string and the corresponding count** modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Below is the implementation of the outlined approach using Python:

```python
from itertools import product

def maxDecodings(e, k):
    n = len(e)
    mod = 998244353
    dp0, dp1, dp2 = [0] * n, [0] * n, [0] * n
    dp2[0] = base = 1 if e[0] == '?' else 1 if '1' <= e[0] <= '9' else 0
    if n > 1:
        dp2[1] = base * (1 if e[1] != '?' and '1' <= e[1] <= '9' else 0)
        dp2[1] += base * (1 if e[:2] == '??' else (9 if e[:2].startswith('1?') else 9 if e[:2].startswith('?1') else 6 if '10' <= e[:2] <= '26' else 0))
    variants = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    possibilities = ['?'] * n
    for i, c in enumerate(e):
        if c != '?':
            dp0[i], dp1[i], dp2[i] = dp2[i-1], dp1[i-1], dp0[i-1]
            if i > 0 and '0' <= e[i-1] <= '9' and '0' <= e[i] <= '9':
                n1, n2 = int(e[i-1] + e[i]), int(e[i-1])
                dp0[i] += dp1[i-2] + dp2[i-2] if 26 >= n1 >= 10 else 0
                dp2[i] += dp1[i-1] if 9 >= n2 >= 1 else 0
        else:
            dp0[i], dp1[i], dp2[i] = dp0[i-1], dp1[i-1], dp2[i-1]
            variants[i].append('?')
            if i > 0:
                if e[i-1] == '?':
                    dp0[i] += dp0[i-2] + dp1[i-2] + dp2[i-2]

The task is to decode a string of digits and question marks into a series of numbers each between \(1\) and \(26\). Every `?` must be replaced with a digit ensuring all numbers fall within this range. The goal is to generate an uncorrupted version having the maximum number of possible decodings.

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we can implement dynamic programming (DP) to calculate the number of ways a substring can be uncorrupted to have a valid encoding, and sort all possible uncorrupted versions lexicographically.

We first define a DP array `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` equals the number of valid encodings for the substring `E[0..i-1]`. `dp[i] += dp[j]` if characters between `j` and `i` can form a valid number (from 1 to 26). We also use a `pre[i]` array to store the last valid ending position for substring `E[0..i-1]`. 

The number of decodings for a substring ending at position `i` can be calculated by summing up the values from `pre[i-1]` up to `E[i-1]`, i.e., by calculating `dp[i]` based on the number of valid substrings starting from `pre[i]` which end at `i`. When encountering a question mark, we consider every valid substitution (1-9) and multiply the results.

Each substring needs to be processed in this way. If the substring is all question marks, the number of possible decodings is simply \(10^{N}\) where `N` is the number of question marks. For substrings containing digits, we calculate the number of possible decodings recursively.

We then sort all substrings lexicographically and find the \(K\)th substring with the maximum decodings. We also need to compute the number of possible decodings modulo \(998244353\).

    for(int i = lo; i < std::min(lo + 2, 10); ++i) {
        string mod = x + to_string(i);
        int cur = solveMod(mod, v, i + 1);
        code add = {mod, (long long)cur * dp[v.size()] % (MOD)};
        v.push_back(add);
        dp.push_back(cur);

Given an encoded string E containing digits and question marks, we must uncorrupt the question marks to digits, ensuring all numbers in the uncorrupted form lie between 1 and 26. The objective is to maximize the number of distinct decodings possible. In case multiple uncorrupted strings have the same maximum number of decodings, we're asked to output the lexicographically Kth largest such string along with the count of distinct decodings modulo 998244353.

</observations>
We employ a dynamic programming approach to count the number of decodings. We will iterate over every character in the encoded string \(E\), grouping characters that could form a single number between 1 and 26 or leaving them as individual digits. This process is constrained based on presence of question marks and leads to different subproblems which can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP).

Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:
- \(dp[i][islude]\) represents the number of ways to decode the substring from position 0 to position \(i\) with/isluded digit at \(i\).
- `islude = 0`: treat current digit as a single digit.
- `islude = 1`: treat current digit as part of two-digit number.

A Binary Search could be employed for evaluating potentially many uncorrupted strings due to combinatorial explosion, ensuring efficient handling of multiple candidates. This is followed by a lexicographical sort to find the Kth largest candidate string.

We are given a string $E$ containing digits and question marks. We need to replace all question marks with digits to form a string that can be split into various valid decodings, each a sequence of numbers between 1 and 26. We seek the lexicographically \(K\)th string among all such strings that can be decoded into the maximum number of different sequences. We then output the number of such sequences modulo \(998,244,353\).
</paraphrased>

<observation> To maximize the number of decoded strings, we should explore all lengths of substrings around each question mark and keep count of valid solutions incrementally.

We can do this with a Dynamic Programming (DP) table $dp[i][j]$, which keeps track of the number of valid decodings from the $i$th character of $E$ to $E$'s end when $j$ is the next character needing to be checked post replacement. 

To find the number of ways to replace the current question mark so that a valid split can be made, check substrings from length 1 up to 2. For each substring, if it forms a valid number, update the DP count. Whenever a problem arises, abort the split since every suffix is affected.

For finding the lexicographically \(K\)th-best uncorrupted encoded string, we relax the recursive checks to avoid exhaustive enumeration while improving the answers through various states. For each $dp[i][j]$, where $dp[i][j] >= K$, backtrack to the smallest possible string that can generate \(K\) valid decoded strings.

Once the computation is over, go through the DP table to ensure all possible valid decodings are included, and return the answer.

The core of the problem is in applying dynamic programming to a string. Starting with all `"?"` set to `0`, we can iterate over each element and determine the potential valid transitions. Our main DP state is `(cursor, value, valid)`:

- \( v \) is the length of the cursor
- \( value \) is the state of the character at the end of the string, \( 0 \) for `"?"`, \( 1-9 \) for digit, and \( 10 \) if a valid character
- \( valid \) is a bitmask indicating whether the preceding or following character is valid, e.g., \( 1 = a_{i-1}! = a_{i+1}! \), \( 2 = a_{i+1}! \), \( 4 = a_{i-1}! \), \( 3 = a_{i-1}! \cap a_{i+1}! \).

We can build the DP as we go from index 0 to the end. Each state transitions to the next state either based on trying to maintain a 2-character number (e.g., `"??", "?4", "2?"`, etc.), or breaking it down into 1-character numbers (e.g., `"??", "??", "?8"`, etc.). 

After populating the DP table, we identify potential uncorrupted strings that allow the most possible decoded strings, retaining only those strings that:

- have a meaningful number at the last character (valid ≥ 4).
- the last character is neither `"?"` nor `'10'` after replacing `"?"` with `'0'`.

Iterate through potential uncorrupted strings, sort them lexicographically, and construct the \(K\)-th such string. Finally, count the number of valid decoded strings modulo 998244353.

We can uncorrupt a string of digits with question marks in many equivalent ways. Be aware of leading zeros and numbers beyond \(26\); reject those. Consider all possible replacements for the question marks to count all valid runs.

Counting decodings for a valid \(n\)-digit encoded string takes \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) time; we apply that recursively. For each replacement, filter the results to those with the greatest number of decodings. Then, find the \(K\)th largest candidate among these. Adding a question mark effectively multiplies the number of possible decodings (unless it is the last character). 

Example: string `12?` has 2 valid decodings `1 2 2` → `BL` and `1 22` → `UB`. We add `?` to this, for instance to get `1?2?`, yielding `11 22` → `KU`, `1 22` → `UB`, `1 22` → `UB`, and `1 2 2 2` → `BLI`. These have a total of 4 decodings, all from valid runs.

# Complexity
Creating a partial candidate takes \(\mathcal{O}(|E| * d)\) for \(d\) possible replacements in question marks; pruning each takes \(\mathcal{O}(|E|)\) on average. This leads to \(\mathcal{O}(d |E|^2)\) complexity; given that \(d \leq 16\) this is acceptable. Array sort does not push us past bounds.

The problem requires uncorrupting a string \(E\) with digits and question marks. This involves replacing question marks with digits and splitting the result into numbers between 1 and 26. The goal is to find the uncorrupted string that maximizes the number of possible decoded strings. When multiple such strings exist, select the \(K\)-th largest lexicographically. The final output requests the number of possible decoded strings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

<observation>For a string like `??2`, replacing the first `?` with a digit has two purposes: forming a valid number, and maximizing the number of possible decodings.</observation>
<observation>To correct every `?` to a digit, we can either concatenate the adjacent `?` or split them into two distinct digits.</observation>
<observation>Concatenating only helps when the next digit or `?` allows for the resulting number to remain <= 26.</observation>
<observation>If the last possible characters can form a valid number (1..26), and has `?` to split, that last chunk should split, as this improves the count of valid ways to split.</observation>

The process involves:
1. Identifying valid possible values to replace `?` with, prioritizing splits that improve the number of valid ways to decode the encoded string.
2. After identifying valid maximal strings, we sort the formed strings in lexicographical order.
3. We then use combinatorics to count the number of ways the string can be decoded, given its structure.
4. This requires dynamic programming over prefix segments, considering the combinatorial possibilities.

We need to build a data structure which holds the chunks of digits into sub-strings.

For the optimal uncorrupted string, we aim for maximum multiples of potential decoded strings. This involves construction through recursion and clever pruning based on dp-utils. For efficiency, we can use DFS and memoization, sorting and backtracking over different ways to fill in '?' placeholders, and taking care to limit on string size and \(K\)th search.

The algorithm below proceeds through strings in critically organized nested-loops for identification of valid splits and then traverses the lexicographical classification with pruning.

To solve the problem, we determine the maximal decodability for each possible substitution of question marks that results in a valid split condition.
- A string has high decodability if it can be split into the most combinations of valid single or double characters.
- This is best determined by counting valid segments incrementally and through the use of dynamic programming.

For replacement with lexicographically \(K\)th largest string, we give every '?' the opportunity to be placed between 0-9 and update the decoded count accordingly. 
- We can then sort the resulting candidates, to extract the \(K\)th largest.

Observe the number of decodable ways is maximized when the string is split into sub-strings each of length one or two which fall within [1, 26]. We can form these splits temporarily during uncorruption and evaluate them.

Our goal is to uncorrupt the string in such a way that we get all potential splits for each substring. We can do this via a dynamic programming setup with `Ways[i][j]` storing possible ways after evaluating `i` positions considering starting substring of length `j`. We might face situations where `i` exceeds `.size` - '0' or overlapping every valid range. To compute the maximum decode count over all possible uncorrupted strings, consider each '?'. For a digit 'n' at position x and 'n + 10' at position x + 1, there are two possibilities: it can start as a number x, or it can be a line of 'x' plus 'n' forming 'xn'. 

Finally, perform lexicographical comparisons starting with the biggest decode count strings generated to identify the K-th string.

To solve the problem, the below strategy applies:
1. Replace every space with `0` temporarily.
2. Segment the string around ‘?’ blocks.
3. For each segment, calculate the number of decodings.
   - Consider breaking the segment into valid prefixes while maintaining valid decoding.
   - Count these valid prefixes leading with a function \(dp[i] =\) number of ways to decode a prefix of length \(i\).
   - Initialize \(dp[0] = 1\) and adjust for leading zeroes and valid splits.
4. Combine results from different segments using combinatorial arithmetic.
5. Collect all uncorrupted strings achieving the highest decodings and sort them lexicographically.
6. Return the K-th largest string, along with the number of decodings modulo \(998244353\).

The task involves a string composed of digits and question marks `?`. We aim to replace each `?` with a digit to maximize the number of ways to decode this string into a valid sequence of characters (where digits from 1 to 26 map to letters A to Z). Additionally, we must return the K-th lexicographically largest string among all optimal replacements and the total number of valid decoded strings modulo 998,244,353.

### Analysis

To tackle this problem efficiently:
1. **Understanding the problem structure**: Each question mark has 10 potential replacements (digits 0-9), leading to exponentially many possibilities.
2. **Dynamic Programming Framework**: Use DP to explore and optimize replacing question marks, leveraging valid decode mappings (1 to 9 and 10-26 separately).
3. **Optimality and Lexicographic Order**:
   - Keep track of the character counts and the number of valid decodings.
   - During individual replacements, maintain the leftmost choices for positions of `?` to maximize lexical value.
4. **Efficiency**: Use digit-combined states for transitions to avoid redundant searches, store pre-generated results efficiently.

### Steps 

1. **Input and Preprocessing**:
   - Parse inputs, calculate the indices for characters at `?` positions.
2. **Memoized DP Transitions**:
   - Define states by the character counts of 1-to-9 and 10-to-26 mappings.
   - Populate and update DP arrays based on DP transitions adding each ?.
3. **Real Decoding Results**:
   - Traverse possible DP states, compute possible replacements.
   - Rebuild from bottom-up to extract the string and counts of valid decodings.

Our dynamic programming approach aims to split the string into parts while maximizing the number of valid decodings. Each '?' can be replaced with any digit from 0 to 9, but we aim to maximize valid splits. To achieve this, we iteratively replace '?' with digits in a way that maximizes possible splits. At each '?', we try replacing it with all possible digits and noting the respective lengths of the substrings it forms.

We handle leading zeroes and merge pairs greedily; if possible, merge consecutive digits or '?'. For a string like `?35`, replace `?` with `1` or `2`. Strings decode multiple ways if they can split into multiple possible valid substrings. By maintaining this procedure, we ensure the string is optimized for maximum splits.

After determining the string with the maximum number of splits, we construct the remaining strings lexicographically to find the Kth one. We print the Kth string and the number of possible decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

To solve this, we need to calculate the maximum length of an encoded string that gives the maximum number of potential decoded combinations. We consider each prefix of the corrupted string and calculate the number of ways each prefix can match to characters up to 26. Character matches are counted as `1-26`, so multiple queries for splits are handled using a vector `dp` for dynamic programming.

A sequence `T` of length \(N\) has a leading question mark `?` replaced by a digit \(d\), then `T[1..N-1]` needs to be taken into account for \(d=0..9\) to ensure it's decodable. For all indices \(i > 0\) starting with `?`, we evaluate dp adjusted for placements.

To find the count of such split characters, we pre-compute a prefix sum of `dp` denoted `pre_sum`. This helps efficiently detect how large the lexographic order of a string is, thus identifying frequencies and leading digits.

For the lexicographically k-th largest string, we note:

- Larger digits should appear early.
- We examine the `pre_sum` array to identify the first digit replacement leading to maximum splits.

### Solution Strategy

1. **Identify Corrupted Positions:** First, identify the positions of the question marks in string \(E\). The strategy involves determining the most optimal replacements by analyzing substrings formed by the question marks.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Decoding Count:** Use dynamic programming to compute the number of ways the string can be decoded at any point. Define a DP array where \(dp[i]\) counts ways to decode up to the \(i\)-th character. For two characters, check for `10` or `2[0-6]`. Otherwise, treat all `?`s as contributing towards numerous ways in many substrings.

3. **Maximize Decoding and Lexicographical Ranking:** To maximize the number of decodings while respecting lexicographical rank \(K\), make strategic decisions at every point of ambiguity, treating every `?` as a `1` as default. If a `?` in a two-digit context could be `0` to extend a letter or `1` to be a new one, both paths yield the same number of ways, but favor `1` for lexicographical order.

4. **Result Construction:** Utilize the DP table, along with a traceback mechanism to construct the desired lexicographically largest encoded string corresponding to the maximum decodings (possibly having ties).

A corrupted encoded string \(E\) must be uncorrupted by replacing all question marks with valid digits \(1-9\). From this, we need to determine which uncorrupted string can produce the maximum number of valid decoded strings. Once the maximum is identified, output the \(K\)th lexicographically largest such string, followed by the number of its decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Constraints:
* \(1 ≤ T ≤ 85\)
* \(1 ≤ |E| ≤ 100{,}000\)
* \(1 ≤ K ≤ 1{,}000{,}000\), less than or equal to the maximum count of decodable strings.
* Digits: \(0-9\), Question marks: `?`
* \(|E|\) total across test cases ≤ \(400{,}000\)

Each uncorrupted version of \(E\) corresponds to distinct letter sequences, based on the digit ranges possible from splitting the string into proper intervals.

To maximize the number of decoded strings for a given corrupted string, leverage dynamic programming. Define a dp array symbolizing the encoded digit sequences leading up to each position. Consider permutations that split the considered section into valid single or two-digit characters and increment your dp array correspondingly.

The optimal strategy involves creating a greedy string based on finding runs of "?". Maximum insertions inside these runs decrease overall uncertainty through elimination. Highest frequency mappings backwards cement validity across maximum possible readings efficiently.

To calculate the number of decodables, start by identifying runs of `?` characters. Each sequence can be filled with permutations of digits such that every two-digit number remains valid. Following Fibonacci sequence principles, current and previous maximum counts infer possible decodings based on contiguous segments across lengths.

If there are \(n\) consecutive ``, it can take on \(F_{n+2} - 1\) decodings, a variation of Fibonacci modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\). Here \(F\) denotes Fibonacci numbers such that \(F_1 = F_2 = 1\). By adding up these counts and validating against specific patterns, you derive the total possible decodings for each string permutation.

Ultimately, your task is to compute and output the \(K\)th largest valid encoded string permutation with maximal count of possible decodings.

<paraphrased>
The task involves deciphering a corrupted encoded string, \(E\), consisting of digits and question marks, into strings with the largest possible number of decodings. For each uncorrupted form of \(E\), determine the maximum number of decodeable strings and return the \(K\)-th largest uncorrupted encoded string that maximizes the number of decodeable strings, along with this count, modulo \(998,244,353\).

### Observations
1. **Decoding Rules**: A valid encoded string must form groups of numbers between 1 and 26. Question marks can represent any digit from 0 to 9, but they cannot result in leading zeros or split invalid groups.
2. **Dynamic Programming for Max Decodings**: To count the maximum decodings, we can use dynamic programming. Let \(dp_i\) represent the number of ways to decode the substring starting at position \(i\) (with internal base cases).
3. **State Transition**: For a character at position \(i\), consider if a group is formed with the subsequent characters, ensuring they form valid numbers (\(1-26\)).
4. **Handling '?'**: '?' can represent any digit. Maintain a recursive dynamic programming approach to propagate all possibilities.
5. **Avoiding Overcounting**: When dealing with consecutive digits, ensure you avoid double-counting by only considering adjacent pairs and non-split scenarios.
6. **Finding K-th Largest String**: Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate all possible decodings, maintaining the actual strings, not just counts, to identify which one is the \(K\)-th largest.
7. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure all calculations are performed modulo \(998,244,353\) for large counts.

### Realization
By leveraging dynamic programming and the BFS approach, the largest number of decodeable strings can be determined, and through careful construction and elimination of overcounted groups, we can ensure the uncorrupted string is generated correctly.

You receive a string E consisting of digits and question marks. Your task is to replace the question marks with digits and split the resulting string into parts where each part translates to a letter (1 to 26). Find the uncorrupted string that can decode into the maximum number of different strings. If there are multiple such strings, choose the lexicographically \(K\)th one. The number of decodings must be output modulo $998{,}244{,}353$. 

The maximum number of possible decoded strings is calculated using a combination of dynamic programming and combinatorics. If a string segment can be split into multiple letters (e.g., "11" can be either "A" or "K"), different splits are considered. Each valid split configuration is counted, and the string is scored based on the total number of valid decodings possible.

We can solve this problem by first calculating the number of possible decodings for every possible way of uncorrupting the string $E$. The state we care about is how many ways a suffix of the string $E$ can be decoded. 

The core of our solution is recursive with memoization or dynamic programming to avoid calculating the same paths multiple times. Function \( dp(id, last) \) returns the number of decodings for suffix $E[id:], last$ denoting that the last thing decoded was a letter greater or equal than $last$, in order to remove invalid splits. We are part way through the string and we look forwards to calculate the remaining possibilities.

We focus on the role of question marks, ensuring to maximize splits by guessing `1` or `2`, and then proceeding to terminate this guess at either an invalid split or a permissible ending. 

When the character is a number, we compute two branches: continuing the current split (e.g. `"1"` potentially extending a "run" of single-digit letters), while also checking if the two-digit split ("`11`") is valid (and count that as an option if it is).

Note also that if a run of single digits spills into a border, we may not count that permutation (e.g., we suspect `"3?8"`, but if `"8"` is alone it would be invalid, hence we consider `"3  8"`, `"38"`).

The final step involves backtracking from the final dp total, using `memo[id] == best_ways` to track every distinct uncorrupted string that produces the maximum number of decodings. We store the strings in order, and once we've acquired all that could be top, we determine the k'th lexicographic match and print it alongside its count.

For each test case, we're given a string and an integer \(K\). The goal is to uncorrupt the string to encode the largest number of possible decoded strings. If there are multiple such cases, we need to return the \(K\)th lexicographically largest.

We start by using dynamic programming to count how many decodings each potential string can generate, denoted as `dp[i][len]` where `i` is a position in the string and `len` is the length of the latest decoded integer code. Our transitions transition `dp[i+1][newlen] += dp[i][len]` if that new code is valid.

We store the possibilities for keys as well as the DP values; we note best keys for each length in a separate list.

Once we've computed the maximum possible number of decodings, indexed it into a remaining set, and enumerated it in reverse alphabetical order, we can compute the keys from the final state, think of each character as either an element or letter with choices generated from each state, assemble these choices to form the final answer string.

The code follows these steps, taking care to handle digit to letter conversion and modulo operations properly. The `calc` function counts the number of valid encoded strings a corrupt string can generate and also tracks the keys. To get the number of decodings `% 998{,}244{,}353` and the Kth best string to encode it, we finally run dfs.

The core approach involves dynamic programming over the possible decodings of substrings. We need to generate all valid uncorrupted encoded strings maximizing the number of decode strings and handle the lexicographic aspect efficiently.

For a substring like `??`, the possibilities are `11`, `12`, ..., `99`, while a single `?` translates to `1` through `9`. For a clean digit string like `12`, the possible interpretations are `12` or `1, 2`, reflecting Fibonacci-like combinations.

Let's calculate the maximum number of decodings from the original string \(E\) by evaluating every contiguous segment of digits and `?`.

We also use a priority queue (min-heap) to retrieve the lexicographically \(K\)th string with maximum decodings. This involves efficiently generating, verifying and ordering uncorrupted strings.

For calculating the Fibonacci series, we use matrix exponentiation for efficiency, which can compute Fibonacci of large indices modulo \(998,244,353\).

Finally, to ensure we have all steps accounted for:

1. Clean up substrings and handle `?` with all digit substitutions successively.
2. Use a priority queue to fetch the \(K\)th best string.
3. When computing max decodings, handle dp from ends considering splits at "?": 
    - E.g., `?12` -> `112`, `212`, `122`, etc.
4. For Fibonacci computations, matrix exponential properties for DP are efficient.

### Implementation

First, implement the helper functions to generate all uncorrupted strings and compute Fibonacci modulo \(998,244,353\).

For maximum readability, let the Fibonacci computation and DP remain modular and separate from `K`-th string retrieval.

General strategy is to first uncorrupt questions to a place they don't cause invalid parses (`001` or `27A`). This must be done greedily, since decision now affects later parts of input. Furthermore, we can only make these decisions based on a local region.

The function `uncorrupt()` attempts this greedily from left-to-right. For example, in `?84?`, we immediately know the first question mark should be `2`.

We then use a dynamic programming approach. `strings[i]` is the number of way to decode the region from i to the end. We recursively compute the values from the back to the front, storing them in `strings[0]`. 

Additionally, we maintain two bit vectors `min` and `max` that store whether a split can occur (1) or not (0) for a given carry value (0 to 9). Initially, `max[i]` for \(0 \leq i \leq 9\), will be set to 1 and all the rest 0. `min[i]` will be populated similarly.

We also have another bit vector `ways_to_decode_from_here[i]` that represent the number of ways a string starting in the given carry position can be decoded from this point forward.

In the end, we run another scan from front to back to output the largest lexicographic string among the longest decoded strings with `strings[0]` bits set, appending zeroes to the end if necessary.

# Implementation

The uncorrupted version of the string that has the most ways to decode has (in general), usually the maximum number of possible decoded strings it could have from questionmark substitution whenever possible. This gives the larger spread of possible multidecoding prefix cases, and thus the greatest overall possible number of decoded strings.

Assuming `9` is always valid, we 'propagate' that `9` as far back as possible (while still ensuring no leading zeros exclusive to a prefixless region). This leads to the highest possible lexographical preference, reducing the current region of subdigits to fewer relevant subregions, corresponding with the fewest ways a digit can decode.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int64_t mod = 998244353;

void uncorrupt(char& c, int& carry, int& min_digit, int& max_digit) {
  if (c >= '1' && c <= '9' && c <= '9' - min_digit) {
    carry += c - '0';
    c = '0';
  } else if (carry != -1 && carry + min_digit <= 9) {
    c = max_digit + '0';
    carry += min_digit;
  } else {
    c = carry = max_digit = min_digit = -1;

For each string of digits let's recursively compute how many of its valid decodings there are. `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to decode the substring `E[i:]`, assuming that it doesn't start with a leading zero. 

If `E[i]` is a digit, then `dp[i]` is simply the sum of `dp[i+1]` (if the first digit forms a valid number when taken alone) and `dp[i+2]` (if the first two digits form a valid number). However, if the first digit is 0, then we treat it as an invalid prefix and don't count `dp[i+1]`.

However, in order to determine the \(k\)-th largest string of digits which can be decoded in the maximum number of ways, we should implement a different strategy. This problem can be approached by sorting permutations of the string and merging corresponding valid counts to find the \(k\)-th largest string.

To solve the problem, we must first uncorrupt the given string \(E\), replacing each '?' with a digit to form valid numbers between 1 and 26.

The problem involves coding one string to another. The string operation is similar to the problem where you're dealing with converting ASCII values to their uppercase or lowercase version, but here, we replace question marks under given constraints. The key insight is to consider splitting properties of strings formed from numbers 1-26 and understand which placements allow for maximum number of decodings.

1. **Uncorrupt the encoded string**: Replace each `?` with digits such that the sequence forms numbers (1-26), and count all possible valid segments.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) to count decodings**: For each position in the string, calculate the number of decodings allowed using two-digit pairs if possible.
3. **Track K-th Lexicographic String**: Maintain an array where each slot tracks the place for the `K`-th uncorrupted string. It evaluates the validity of each modification for `?` as `0`, `1-9`, `i+j`.

We have a string of digits and question marks. To solve it, we use dynamic programming to determine the number of decodings possible from any substring. Let `dp(i)` denote the number of decodings starting at position \(i\). We initialize this to \(0\) for all positions, except for the last position which is obviously \(1\). For each substring beginning at \(i\), the value `dp[i]` equals the number of decodings starting there, which might vary between \(1\) and \(2\) according to whether we can form a valid 1 or 2-character code.

Every `?` can be replaced to make numbers from `1` to `9`. A `?` can also combine with the next digit to form a valid two-digit number if that digit is within \([1][0-9]\) to \([2][0-6]\).

By iterating from right to left, we build up a solution representing the maximum decodings for all substrings. We then identify the substrings with the maximum possible decodings, and among those, determine the \(K\)th lexicographically largest uncorrupted string. Computing the number of arrays whose concatenation would lead to a certain string can be optimised using DP and binary lifting. The number of decodings is then calculated modulo 998,244,353.

To find uncorrupted encoded strings with the maximum possible number of decodings:
1. Count frequencies for each 1-digit and 2-digit number combination over the input.
2. If a "??" occurs, classify it as "11".
3. Starting from the first character, replace question marks with digits aiming to maximize the number of possible decodings, prioritizing lexicographically if not already minimized.
4. Since "??" occurrence could lead to substantial increase in the number of decodings, ensure such occurrences are counted as possibly being "11".
5. For each "?", knowing the actual digit combinations that could arise post assignment, compute the new frequency.
6. At each segment of input:
   - If the current segment is "??", treat as becoming "11".
   - If not, consider possible assignations post digit replacement.
7. Maintain a data structure to dynamically keep track of the counts and prioritize lexicographical candidates for "??" scenarios.
8. Depending on settings, determine additional '?''s will not surpass the current max count, if true then preserve the current string as potential output.
9. Finally, when complete, determine the K-th largest such string and output its counts in terms of M.

A simplified pseudo code:
```cpp
N, K, MOD = 998244353
for (case = 1 to T):
  E = input()  // take encoded string
  max_id = ""  // Initialize max identifier
  max_count = 0  // Maximum count of decodings

        // update frequency based on whether single digit or pair match
        newValue = determineOptimalMapping(i, E, a, b)

To solve this problem efficiently, we adopt a dynamic programming strategy combined with greedy choices for leading zeroes and digit splits. Given a question mark, we need to test each possible digit to determine the highest possible number of decodable outputs. This involves constructing a cumulative matrix D for each digit replacement, where each state is its possible decoded strings count. 

To achieve lexicographical maximization, a priority prioritizes highest lexicographical value while balancing valid splits. Any invalid split caused by leading zeros or exceeding the range will be backtracked.

Every question mark will incrementally fill in its optimal digit. If more than one optimal digit exists, the lexicographically highest one is considered. Since the problem specifies \(K\), binary search can be adopted efficiently to find the lexicographically \(K\)th permutation among multiple optimal solutions, improving manageability on larger inputs.

Given a string and question marks, replacing question marks maximizes the number of possible decoded strings if we align question marks such that decoding into numbers between 1 and 26 is possible. Example: `??2` could be decoded as `12`, `22`, `112`, `212`.
</observation>

If we have a sequence like `?2`, it makes sense to decode it as `12` (one possibility) or `22` (one possibility), maximizing the number of possible splits. However, for `2?`, the best would be `21` (one possibility).

The algorithm leverages dynamic programming to manage the problem efficiently, considering the constraints of leading zeros and valid substrings (1 to 26 digits).

For each possible uncorrupted string $s$, we count the number of possible decoded strings. By trying out each possible uncorrupted string, we can record them paired with their count.

This can be done with a depth-first search. Handle question marks by branching on the values `0, 1, 2, ..., 9`. Skip creating encoded substrings that are invalid, and we will branch at most $26$ times per `?` to get the possible number of decodings as we handle each `?`.

One tricky edge case is the sequence `1012`. This can be decoded `ACAB`, `KAB`, `LAB`. The transitions given by the substring `10` are required. We structure the dynamic programming array, dp[i][j], as the number of strings that can decode the prefix up to $i$ characters that were `?`s and ending with `j`, where $j$ can be $0, 1,...,2` (to ensure valid splits).

If valid splits are collected with all lexicographically ordered, then the indexed string corresponding to $K$ can be selected and it's count.

We use a DFS to explore all valid and possible encodings for the current string. The pairs of ($i^{th}$ index position, $j^{th}$ number ends with $j$) are processed in a depth-first traversal. We save results to a hashmap while marking visited nodes.

Finally for each case, we find and return answer for \(K^{th}\) largest valid string.

To solve the problem, first, we parse the input, replacing `?` with a digit generating all valid substitutions in lexicographical order. We'll use dynamic programming to find the possible interpretations of each possible substitution.

Key steps:

1. For each uncorrupted string, we determine the number of possible interpretations by Dynamic Programming.
2. As we iterate over the substitutions, we also keep track of the lexicographical position in descending order.
3. Once we find the $K$-th substitution, we can return the number of its interpretations, modulo $998{,}244{,}353$.

Given a string E of digits and question marks, where question marks signify corruption, the task is to replace each question mark with a digit to form an uncorrupted string. The uncorrupted string should be split such that all parts are valid alphabetic codes (1 to 26), without leading zeros. The aim is to find the uncorrupted string that can decode to the maximum possible number of distinct strings, and output the Kth lexicographically largest among these. Additionally, provide the count of possible decoded strings modulo 998,244,353.
</paraphrased>

<constraint_analysis>
\(1 \leq T \leq 85\): There are up to 85 test cases.
\(1 \leq |E| \leq 100{,}000\): Each string E can be very long.
\(1 \leq K \leq 1{,}000{,}000\): K can be large.
Overall, the sum of \(|E|\) is at most $400{,}000$, which requires an efficient solution to avoid time limit issues.

### Implications
Given the constraints, a naive approach of iterating through each possible combination of 10 or more large strings would time out. Therefore, we need an optimized approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or other efficient enumeration methods.

### Observations
1. The strings can become very long, requiring us to efficiently compute the number of possible valid decodings (hence a dynamic programming approach works well).
2. Lexicographical order implies we need to maintain the characters in ascending sorted order.
3. Modulo arithmetic for output values simplifies the large combinatorial calculations involved.

### Key Strategies
1. Dynamic programming to efficiently calculate possible decode counts.
2. Using frequency counts of possible splits that lead to valid decodes.
3. Optimize the permutations based on lexicographical preferences.

To solve, we develop a frequency table \(F\) where \(F[i]\) signifies the number of ways to decode starting from position \(i\). We use dynamic programming to fill this table by iterating through the encoded string and for each possible valid partial decode, maintaining a count of how many ways we can reach that point.

We then generate a secondary table \(L\) to keep the distances, which is the distance between the furthest decoded value in \(F\) and the current index. This paired with \(F\) serves to record possibilities of decoded strings.

We need to consider the positions of question marks and their alignment with digits. After processing, we form unique decode strings using a power-of-2 mask for each decoded string we can generate. We extract these, sort them, and find the \(K\)th in the processed list.

The final output is the \(K\)th lexicographically unique decode pattern based on \(L\) and its associated decode count dependent on modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

To obtain an uncorrupted string that can be decoded to the maximum number of strings, and also help determine the lexicographically \(K\)th largest such string among all uncorrupted strings with the same maximum number of decoded strings.

We follow these steps:

1. For a string \(S\), we need to find the number of ways to decode it. Define `ways[i]` to be the number of valid decodings for the substring starting from index \(i\) to the end of the string. 
   
   - With valid characters, we can prepend any single-digit number (1-9) and valid two-digit numbers (10-26) for consecutive substrings.
   
2. After that, we binary search over all strings that could achieve the maximum number of decodings.

3. Given one such viable string (say, `T`), extract its associated encoded string. This encoded string corresponds to a lexicographically maximal encoded string that can be derived from the uncorrupted string `M`.

This approach avoids generating all valid strings explicitly, which would be prohibitively expensive in space and time.

The core of the problem involves maximizing decodings while ensuring we replace `?` with digits that preserve the [1, 26] constraint. We want the specific \(K\)th replacement that maximizes decodings.

- Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array such that \(dp[i]\) denotes the number of ways to decode the substring starting at \(i\).
- Since every string or substring is a potential number, it can be single or double digits, so there are three logical splits at each position, considering `1`-, `2`-, and `21-`digit replacements.
- Update the value of \(dp[i]\) based on the possible decodings of substrings starting from \(i\).
- Special handling is needed for terms such as `?3`, `?5`, which can allow either `13`/`15` or `23`/`25`, affecting computation.

Given this, let's find the uncorrupted string that maximizes possible answers and be \(K\)th largest. This requires generating candidates through breadth-first search (BFS), enumerating legal replacements, and maintaining a priority queue (PQ) sorted lexicographically to track the \(K\)th largest candidate efficiently.

Simulation shows how replacing `?` with different digits impacts lexicographic order and number of decodings. We maintain a PQ for candidates, adding potential splits recursively. Each PQ entry holds the index being processed, followed by `0` to denote no split, or `1` to prompt a recursive split.

After computing all possibilities, return the PQ’s \(K\)th best item and its count.

We need to convert a string containing digits or question marks into a string of digits such that the number of possible valid decoding strings is maximized. 
Among all such strings, we must find the \(k\)-th lexicographically largest one and output the number of decodable strings of the selected largest string.

- Specific order of how to change digits: All `?` digits should be replaced with `1`s because `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19` are valid, but `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, `25`, `26` have fewer possible decoding strings.
- The dynamic programming problem involves calculating the maximum number of ways to decode a string and also remembering the way back.
- Once we have the maximum number of ways to decode a string, we select the \(k\)-th largest one in lexicographical order (by generating permutations).
- We use combinatorics to count the number of ways to arrange the digits.

<paraphrased>
Given a corrupted string \(E\), our goal is to find the uncorrupted string that can decode into the maximum number of possible strings, and to provide the lexicographically \(K\)th largest uncorrupted string for those possibilities, along with the count of such decoded strings modulo \(998,244,353\).

To maximize the number of possible decoded strings, we need to strategically replace the `?` characters with digits such that splitting the string into valid codewords is maximized. 

**Key Observations:**

1. **Decoding Rules**:
    - Valid codes are from \(1\) to \(26\).
    - Numbers greater than \(26\) or having leading zeros are invalid.
    
2. **Decoding Count**:
    - We need a way to compute the number of valid decodings.
    - A dynamic programming (DP) approach is effective here, where `dp[i]` counts the number of ways to decode up to the `i`th character. 
    - Transitions occur based on three scenarios:
        1. Single-digit: \(dp[i] += dp[i-1]\) if \( i \neq 0\).
        2. Double-digit from \(10-26\): \(dp[i] += dp[i-2]\) if valid.
   
3. **Largest Uncorrupted String**:
    - Iterate through all possible uncorrupted strings and choose the \(K\)th largest string among those that maximize the decoding count.
    
4. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Use modulo \(998,244,353\) for the decoding count to avoid overflow. 

Let's achieve the solution through implementation:

Given a string with question marks, find the unassigned digit values that maximize the number of decodings and the lexicographically Kth uncorrupted string.
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
We are provided with a string of digits containing some question marks. The task is to uncorrupt the string by assigning digits to the question marks such that the resulting encoded string can be split into a maximum number of possible decoded strings representing letters A-Z (encoded as 1-26). We should then find the lexicographically Kth string amongst those uncorruptions and the count of all such decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

To solve this:
1. We'll compute the number of ways each substring can be decoded.
2. Assign question marks to maximize this count.
3. Track the lexicographically largest uncorrupted string and respective count possible.
4. Output the Kth largest amongst all such strings with the maximum decodings.

The length of E can be up to \(100{,}000\), so any dynamic programming solution must compute in linear time.

The sum of \(|E|\) is at most \(400{,}000\) across all test cases, so there will likely be multiple DP states per test case; each state should compute very quickly.

## Implementation
First, we define functions to compute the DP of decodings and handle splits with question marks. We construct suffix values for optimal splits and decode counts, and track the largest uncorrupted string. Finally, we maintain a list of such strings for the highest decoding counts and extract the Kth largest.

int K;

// Precompute decodings
vector<pair<int, string>> precompute(const string& str, int index = 0) {
    int n = str.size();
    vector<pair<int, string>> splits(n * 2);
    dp[n] = 1;
    splits[2 * (n - 1)] = {1, ""};

    // Compute DP values and splits from end to start
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        char ch = str[i];
        if (ch == '?' || '1' <= ch && ch <= '9') {
            dp[i] = (dp[i + 1] + ch == '0' || (i + 1 < n && (ch == '2' && str[i + 1] >= '7'))) ? 0 : 1;
        } else dp[i] = 0;

        if (index < K && splits[i * 2] == splits[i * 2 + 1]) {
            splits[i * 2] = {splits[i * 2].first + dp[i], splits[i * 2].second};
        } else if (index < K) {
            splits[i * 2 + 1].first += dp[i];
            if (splits[i * 2 + 1].first > splits[i * 2].first)
                swap(splits[i * 2], splits[i * 2 + 1]);
            index++;
        }

        ch = '0';
        int val = ((ch - '0') * 10 + (int)(i + 1 < n ? (str[i + 1] - '0') : 0)) % MOD;
        splits[i * 2].second = string(ch + ((i + 1 < n && val <= 26) ? str[i + 1] : '0'));
    }
    splits[0].second = str;
    return splits;
}
