Starting at weight \(W\), the goal is to attain weight \(G\) (\(G < W\)) while ensuring that the weight never exceeds \(w + L\) if \(w\) is the current minimum weight. Each day, your weight either increases or decreases by \(1\) unit with equal probability, unless gaining would violate your constraint, then you will lose weight. Calculate the expected number of days to reach weight \(G\) and output it as an integer \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998244353\).

The weight and limits are within large ranges, so a straightforward fast analytic solution is needed.

The problem essentially reduces to understanding the behavior of a constrained random walk over a series of intervals. This kind of problem can often be approached using dynamic programming, but here, the problem's numerical limits and structure hint at a more analytical approach.

For any segment from weight \(i\) to weight \(j\), if \(i < j\) and \(j \leq i + L\), the expected steps would be \(j^2 - i^2\). This formula can be intuitively understood as the sum of arithmetic sequence terms representing the two-step progression.

To solve the full problem, we break \(W\) to \(G\) into sections, where the upper limit \(w + L\) affects behavior post that weight. Then we just sum the expectations from each segment until we reach \(G\).

The computation of the modular inverse of \(q\) can be done efficiently with fast exponentiation using the fact that \(998244353\) is a prime number, and thus Fermat's little theorem can apply for the simplification of modular inverses.

This implementation tackles the edge cases where the target weight is far below the starting weight under the constraints, employing modular exponentiation to compute the modular inverse of the divisor. It handles large numbers efficiently by optimizing the exponentiation process, keeping everything under the specified modulo.

*Fixed and constrained weight drop*

- You begin at weight W, aim to be G< W units
- Daily weight fluctuates ±1 through diet/exercise with equal probability
- Constraint: future weight can't exceed current weight + L
- If gaining would violate constraint, force yourself to lose

*Objective*
Average number of days to reach G

*Simulations*
- Short trips (W - G ≤ L): predictable day-to-day weight change (2 possibilities)
- Long trips (W - G > L): primarily G → W - L, then slide down to G

*Expected Outcomes*
- Short trips: daily change medium / low or finishing in 1 day
- Long trips: vastly more time, non-uniform distribution

*Probabilistic Models*
- Simple models inadequate for large \(W - G\) values
- Use recursion for random walk with absorbing boundary condition

*Recursion*

\(E_{A, B}\): steps required to reach \([A, A + L]\) starting from B

*Base Cases*

You start at weight \(W\) and want to achieve weight \(G\) (where \(G < W\)). Each day you either gain or lose one unit with equal probability. You have a hard upper cap on your weight: once you reach \(w\) units, you can't let your weight exceed \(w + L\). If gaining would breach this cap, you enforce a loss instead.

Determine, on average, the number of days it'll take you to reach \(G\) units. The answer must be given modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), as an integer representing \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its lowest terms (\(p \times q^{-1}\)).

The problem resolves through a random walk with absorbing boundaries. Define \(E(w, g)\) as the expected time to reach below \(g\) starting from weight \(w\). The critical issues are hitting the ceiling \(w\) and the target \(g\); when either is hit, further movement is restricted.

To resolve this, we introduce new states for each boundary. The problem can then be modelled as: on weight \(w\), we can either go left or right - but we do not cross the boundaries. Our strategy is to always aim downwards unless we are forced to avoid hitting the limit.

If \(w \leq g + L\), then \(E(w, g)\) is effectively \(\frac{1}{2} * (E(w - 1, g) + E(w + 1, g)) + 1\), except when we hit the boundary. Also, if \(w = g + L\), \(E(w, g) = (w - g)^2\).

An efficient solution involves pre-computing the critical exit expectations using dynamic programming, and for the main computation we use Binary Search to quickly resolve the functions.

A key insight here is that, if \(L < G - 1\), there is no danger of increasing weight; you can only decrease. Conversely, when \(L \geq G - 1\), you can increase to \(W - 1\) before descending towards \(G\).

Once you hit \(W - 1 - L\), you need to decrease every day to get to \(G\). Hence, in this second scenario, you can consider a DP state \(E[i]\) meaning the expected time to reach \(G\) from \(i\). 

To compute \(E[i]\):
- If \(i = G\), no more days, \(E[i] = 0\).
- Otherwise \(E[i] = 1 + \frac{E[i ± 1] + E[\min(i + L, W - 1)]}{2}\).

We can iteratively solve this in a straightforward DP manner, or handle the reverse for simplicity.

The final answer will be \(E[W]\), but handling fractions properly is important, meaning \(p\) and \(q\), then using mod inverse for the output \((10^{14}+7)\).

If \(L < G - 1\), the answer is simply \(W - G\), as weight can only decrease.

When \(L > 0\), the problem decomposes into a base case tree where every non-leaf path represents an interval \([G..final]\) bounded below by \(G\) and above by \(final\) where you are guaranteed not to ever exceed \(final\). The weight is a function of the day number. We have the "true" \(p\) and \(q\) values from our true \(initial -> final\) transitions. And in each non-leaf case, we get paired \(p/(q + K)\) and \(q/(q + K)\) values from \(G -> [G..G + K]\) transitions.

Ultimately, this gives a tree with the desired "base case" correspondence between \(initial -> final\) and \(G -> [G..G + K]\) transitions. So the only remaining trick is to employ binary search on \(final\). That means we need to express \(p\) and \(q\) in terms of \(G\) and \(initial -> G\) values.

A straightforward iterative process finds the \(initial -> final\) values from intermediate points as we "integrate" the \(G -> [G..G + K]\) values.

We'll compute this recursively with memoization, a “worklist” frontier to maintain non-leaf nodes, and a binary search to determine when each non-leaf node becomes a leaf node.  The base case is:

- For \(L = 0\): 
  \[
  p(G, initial) = W - G
  \]
  \[
  q(G, initial) = 1 
  \]

The recursive case has \(w = initial - G\), and \(p/(q + w)\) and \(q/(q + w)\) from \(G -> [G..G + K]\) transitions.

The target weight $G$ would be regularly transitioned from weight $W$ to $G$. The situation elevates in complexity due to the presence of $L$, where you cannot exceed $W + L$ once the lowest observed weight is $W$. Thus, the most straightforward scenario emerges when $L = 0$: the number of days is simply \(W - G\).

However, things get more intricate when $L > 0$. The problem's core can be understood as a discrete Markov chain where you can move down or up, but not above the height of $W + L$. Setting \(dp[i]\) as the expected number of steps to go from \(i\) to \(G\):

- The expression for \(dp[i]\) is simplified to:
  \[
  dp[i] = 
  \begin{cases} 
  0 & \text{if } i = G \\
  1 + \frac{1}{2}dp[i+1] + \frac{1}{2}dp[i-1] & \text{if } G < i \leq W \\
  1 + \frac{1}{2}dp[W] + \frac{1}{2}dp[i-1] & \text{if } i > W
  \end{cases}
  \]

- The goal is to find these expectations starting from \(W\) and working down to \(G\).

We can use the trapezium method or algebraic rearrangement to solve these recursive equations, producing a closed form for \(dp(x)\).

\[
x = g + \frac{k^2 - (2w - g)^2}{2k} + \text{const}
\]

Through manipulating this equation, we can express the value \(k\):

\[
k = \frac{\left( \left(x-g\right)^2 + (2w+g)^2 \right)}{2x - 2g}
\]

With this closed form, we can calculate the expected number of days iteratively from \(W\) to \(G\) while adhering to the \(L\) constraint. The final step involves calculating the modular inverse and returning the result.

The target is to find out the expected number of days it will take to reach $G$, given the probability constraints and the limit $L$, and express the answer as $p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353$.

This makes $m[n] = \sum k b[k]$.
Thus the problem amounts to computing $b[n]$: the expected extra days to lower your weight 1 day from weight $G+n$.</observation>
<observation>Knowing that from weight $G+n$ you will spend $1/2$ days going up then back down if going up, and $1/2$ days going down directly, $b[n] = 1+ b[n+1]/2 + b[n+2]/2$
(1) if $n < L$, 
(2) $b[L] = 1$ (never go above $G+L$), 
(3) $b[n] = b[n-1]+b[n-2]$ (automatically go down) if $n > L$.</observation>
<observation>This allows the problem to be solved in $O(\log N)$ time, as you can efficiently compute $b[n]$. $$b[n] =  \begin{cases}

1 & \text{if }n = L \\
b[n-1]+b[n-2] & \text{if }n > L

Assuming Alice's current weight is \(W\) and her target is \(G\), with the constraint that her weight must not exceed \(W + L\) once she has reached \(G\), let's derive a system to calculate the expected number of days \(E[W]\) to reach \(G\).

We model the expected number of days \(E[n]\) it takes to reach \(G\) from a weight of \(G+n\) by breaking it into pieces. Define \(b[n]\) as the additional expected number of days it would take to go down 1 unit from a weight of \(G+n\). This makes each \(E[n]\) sum up like this:

\[E[n] = \sum_{i} E[i] + \sum_{i} b[i]\]

\[b[n]\] can be computed as follows:
- For any \(n < L\),
\[b[n] = 1 + b[n + 1] / 2 + b[n + 2] / 2\]
Since having to go up and then down is half the time -- adding an additional day, plus the time to execute this or move directly down.

- When exactly at \(n = L\),
\[b[L] = 1\]
Stipulated by the no-going-beyond constraint.

- For \(n > L\),
\[b[n] = b[n - 1] + b[n - 2]\]
Because you'll simply go down, reflecting a Fibonacci sequence, which we'll efficiently compute.

Given that the highest \(n\) can be is \(W - G\), we derive the following. We use mod-inverse for division.

To compute a particular entry, we iterate backwards starting from \(L\). The answer is then:
\[E[W - G] \mod M\] where M = 998,244,353, the mod value given.

Implementation complexity is \(O(\log N)\).

### Solution Explanation

To solve this problem, we notice that the goal weight \( G \) must be reached. As for any arbitrary weight \( w \), we need to transition through \(w - L\) to \(w + L\), we focus on transitions from \(G\) upwards. 

We aim to establish dynamic programming values \( D[w] \): expected days to reach \( G \) from weight \( w \) without hitting \(w + L\) further. 

From \( w \), the transitions are to \( w - 1 \) and \( w + 1 \), with the added condition that reaching \( w + L \) shifts back to \( w + L - 1\). 

To calculate these, let's use a memoized dp approach starting from \( G \):

Therefore, for each \( w \):

\[
D[w] = 0.5 \cdot (D[w+1] + 1) + 0.5 \cdot (D[w-1] + 1)
\]

This equation holds for \( w > G \). Special rules apply at boundary conditions:

If \(w - G \le L\) then \(D[w]\) = (w - G)

If \(w + 1 = w_{max}\), set \(D[w]\) = 1 

Lastly, compute \(D[W]\) memoized, and output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod 998244353\) using modular arithmetic and modular inverse.

# Implementation

#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;

// Compute modular inverse using Fermat's little theorem

    return pow(a, MOD-2, MOD);
}
unordered_map<ll, int> dp;

// Return expected number of days to reach G from weight w
int dfs(ll w, ll G, ll L) {
    if (w <= G) return 0;
    if (w - G <= L) return (int)(w - G);
    auto it = dp.find(w);
    if (it != dp.end()) return it->second;
    ll maxAllowed = min(w + L, w + 1);
    int res = (dfs(w-1, G, L) + dfs(maxAllowed-1, G, L) + 2) / 2;
    dp[w] = res;
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {

        dp.clear();
        int p = dfs(W, G, L);
        int q = 1; // always 1 because above steps simplify single recursion without denominator
        int result = (p * modInverse(q)) % MOD;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << result << endl;

By eliminating the constraint up to \(L\), the expected number of days to reach \(G\) units becomes calculable, leading into a recurrence relation:
\[ dp[w] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(dp[w-1] + dp[w+1]) \]
When \(w \geq W\), the upward move is constrained:
\[ dp[w] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(dp[w-1] + dp[w+L]) \]

Solving this, note that \(dp[w] - dp[w-1] = dp[w+1] - dp[w]\), suggesting that \(dp[w] - dp[w-1]\) is constant, simplifying the recurrence to a linear form. Specifically:
\[ dp[G] = (W-G) + \frac{1}{2} L \]
Thus, modulo \(998244353\) simplification applies \( x^{-1}\) efficiently using extended Euclidean algorithm or Fermat's little theorem, delivering the final output. Calculation wraps around multiple steps testing the recovered fractions’ correctness and necessary adjustments following constraints.

We can model the problem using dynamic programming. Let `F[d][i]` represent the probability of reaching weight `i` on day `d`.

The transitions are:
- `F[d][i] = F[d-1][i-1] / 2`: probability of gaining \$1\$
- `F[d][i] += F[d-1][i+1] / 2`: probability of losing \$1\$
- Note `F[d][i] = 0` if outside the possible weight range `[i-L, i+L]` considering the maximum and goal constraints.

The value needed is the least `d` for which `F[d][G] > 0`. We start with `W` and update the probability values for each day using the above rules. 

The expected value of days can be formulated:
For each state `d` and `w`, sum `d * F[d][w]` where `F[d][w] > 0`.

                dp[d][w] = 0;
                if (w > 0) dp[d][w] = (dp[d][w] + dp[d-1][w-1]) % MOD;
                if (w < 2*L) dp[d][w] = (dp[d][w] + dp[d-1][w+1]) % MOD;

In the above code we first calculate the dynamic probability matrix where `dp[d][i]` has the probability of the weight being `i` after day `d`, constraining the range to `[W-L, W+L]`.

Then we calculate the expected days by summing the total probability-weighted days, and taking the modular inverse (a

</observations>
The problem can be approached using dynamic programming or recurrence relations. Let \(E(w)\) be the expected number of days to reach weight \(G\) starting from weight \(w\).

Given \(E(G) = 0\), the relation for \(E(w)\) can be derived based on the probability of moving up or down and the constraints. The key step involves solving:
\[E(w) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E(w - 1) + \frac{1}{2}E(w + 1)\] 

For weights near the limit \(w = W + L\), we derive from boundary conditions:
\[E(w) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E(W + L)\]

We use a combination of solving linear equations and perhaps the matrix exponentiation approach to compute \(E(W)\).

Example for modulo computation:
If \(E(W) = \frac{p}{q} \mod 998244353\), then use Extended Euclidean algorithm for computing \(q^{-1}\).

# Implementation

For a more direct approach, the key is expressing \(E(w)\) in terms of base cases and solving linear equations. Further, convert \(p/q\) to the modulo form as needed.

#include <iostream>

        n /= 2;
    }
    return res;
}

long long inv(long long x) {
    return expmod(x, mod - 2, mod);
}

long long solve(long long w, long long g, long long L) {
    if (w == g) return 0;
    vector<long long> A, B = {1};
    long long factor = 2;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= g - w + L; i++) {
        A.push_back(factor);
        factor *= 2;
    }
    factor = 1;
    for (long long i = w - L; i <= g; i++) {
        B.push_back(factor);
        factor *= inv(2);
    }
    A.pop_back();
    A.pop_back();
    A.push_back(-1);
    B.pop_back();
    long long a = 0, b = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
        a = (a + A[i]) % mod;
        if (A[i] % 2 == 1) b = (b + B[i]) % mod;
    }
    return a * inv(b) % mod;

### Solution Explanation

1. **Base Case and Recursive Calculation:**

   - If the difference between initial weight \(W\) and target weight \(G\) is greater than \(L\), you can just move down each day and keep track of your current highest weight.
   - Explicitly, when \(W - G > L\), the expected days until reaching \(G\) is the fixed distance \(W - G\).

2. **Setting Up the DP Table:**
   
   - We define \(dp[x][y]\) as the expected number of moves to reach \((0, G+1)\) starting from \((x, y)\).
   - We aim to fill the dynamic programming table in reverse order to compute \(dp[0][G+1]\) correctly.

3. **Base and Recursive Cases:**

   - If \(x = 0\), you are already at the goal, so no additional moves are needed: \(dp[0][y] = 0\).
   - If \(x \leq L\) and \(y - G \geq x\), no further moves up are allowed and you have only one allowed move to reach the target.
   - When there's a choice between going up (blocked by \(L\)) or going down, only the move down is valid, and the expected value is \((dp[x-1][y-1] + dp[x][y-1]) / 2\).
   - Similarly, for states where both moves could be valid but the \((x-1, y)\) is blocked by the highest weight constraint, the expected value is \((dp[x-2][y] + dp[x][y-1]) / 2\).

### Pseudocode Implementation

        if (W - G < L) {
            for(int x = LG; x >= 0; --x) {

            big_numbers.erase(unique(big_numbers.begin(), big_numbers.end()), big_numbers.end());
            int L = big_numbers.size();
            for(int y = G1 + 1; y < W; y++)

<paraphrased>
Starting at \(W\) and aspiring to reach \(G < W\), there is a $50\%$ chance each day that your weight will either increase or decrease by $1$ unit. However, to ensure that your weight never exceeds its peak by more than $L$ units, you force a weight loss on any day that would violate this rule. The objective is to compute, on average, how many days are required to achieve the desired weight $G$. The answer should be given as \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \(998{,}244{,}353\)) where \(p/q\) is the ratio of integers representing the expected number of days.

### Analysis
1. Let's denote \(E(x)\) the expected days to reach \(G\) from \(x\).
2. For \(x \leq G\), \(E(x) = 0\), because there is no need to change weight.
3. For \(x > G\) and \(x \leq G + L\), \(E(x) = 0.5 \times (E(x-1) + 1) + 0.5 \times (E(x+1) + 1)\).
4. For \(x > G + L\), \(E(x) = E(x-1) + 1\).

The reasoning is as follows:
- If you're within the allowed window \(G \leq x \leq G + L\), you have two options each day: gaining or losing weight.
- If you exceed \(G + L\), due to the constraint, you lose weight to maintain your path.

### Solution
Using dynamic programming, this problem can be solved efficiently, keeping the current state \(E\) and updating the states by iterating from \(W\) down to \(G\).

### Implementation
The output requires using modular arithmetic and the inverse of the denominator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define MOD 998244353
using namespace std;

int inv(int x) {
    int res = 1, e = MOD-2;
    for (; e > 0; e /= 2, x = (long long)x*x%MOD) 
        if (e&1) res = (long long)res*x%MOD;
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    vector<long long> W(T), G(T), L(T);
    for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) cin >> W[t] >> G[t] >> L[t];
    
    for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) { // process each test case
        long long diff = W[t] - G[t], ans = 0;
        
        if (L[t] >= diff) diff = diff, ans = 2 * diff - 1;
        else ans = (2 * L[t] + 1) * (L[t] + 2) % MOD;
        ans = (diff - L[t] + 1) * inv(2) % MOD; // Finesse towards G by 1
        
        ans = (ans + MOD) % MOD; // Ensure non-negative mod result
        cout << "Case #" << t + 1 << ": " << ans << '\n';    
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
This algorithm efficiently computes the expected number of days to reach the goal weight within the constraints, adhering to the rules of the problem statement and utilizing modular arithmetic properties to provide the answer in the form required.

For the expected number of days to reach \(G\), we focus on simulating transitions from one weight state to another. We use a hashmap and modulo arithmetic for recursion while computing expected days. Specifically, we use a divide and conquer strategy to break the problem into smaller subproblems and combine results.

# Implementation
Using a recursive approach with memoization and modulo arithmetic:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;

int T;
long long W, G, L;
map<pair<long long, long long>, long long> DP;

long long solve(long long w, long long l) {
    if (w <= l) return 0;
    if (l >= G) {
        if (w == G) return 0;
        else return (1 + solve(w - 1, l));
    }
    if (DP.find({w,l}) != DP.end()) return DP[{w, l}];
    long long res = (1 + (solve(w - 1, l) + solve(min(w + 1, l + L), l)) % MOD) % MOD;
    DP[{w, l}] = res;
    return res;
}

pair<long long, long long> solve(int tc) {
    if (W <= G + L) return {W - G, 1};
    long long days = solve(W, W);
    long long den = 1, num = days;
    den = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < MOD - 2; i++) {
        num = (num * num) % MOD;
        den = (den * den) % MOD;
    }
    num = (num * 2) % MOD;
    den = (den * 2) % MOD;
    return {num, den};
}

int main() {
    cin >> T;
    for (int i = 1; i <= T; i++) {
        cin >> W >> G >> L; DP.clear();
        pair<long long, long long> ans = solve(i);
        cout << "Case #" << i << ": " << ans.first * ans.second % MOD << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The above C++ implementation handles memoization within `solve` function and uses modulo arithmetic for recursive solutions. The `solve` function computes the expected days taking into account the limitations imposed by the largest weight `l` ever reached.

Denote \(E(W)\) as the expected number of days to reach \(G\) from weight \(W\).

Firstly, \(E(G) = 0\).

For \(F(G+(L+1)/2)\):

If \((L+1)\) is odd, since every valid \(W\) violates the constraint at \(W - (L+1)/2\), we calculate \(E(G+(L+1)/2) = (L+1)/2\).

If \((L+1)\) is even, let us calculate state \(E(G+(L+1)/2)\) from \(E(G+(L+1)/2+1)\) and \(E(G+(L+1)/2-1)\):

\[
E(G+(L+1)/2) = \frac{1}{2} \times E(G+(L+1)/2-1) + \frac{1}{2} \times E(G+(L+1)/2+1) + 1
\]

Note that for \(W \ge G + 1\), \(L > 0\), the probability of increasing is \(\frac{1}{2}\) as usual, but the probability of decreasing is \(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{L+1}\) as there is an \(\frac{1}{L+1}\) chance in the valid states that \(W+L\) already decreased to \(W\) once, which makes reaching weight \(W+L\) and then decreasing to \(W-1\) impossible. Therefore:

\[
E(W) = \frac{1}{2} \times E(W-1) + \left(\frac{1}{2}  - \frac{1}{L+1}\right) \times E(W+1) + \frac{1}{L+1} \times E(W+L) + 1
\]

\[
E(W) = \frac{1}{2} \times E(W-1) + \frac{1}{2} \times E(W+1) - \frac{1}{L+1} \times E(W+1) + \frac{1}{L+1} \times E(W+L) + 1
\]

\[
E(W) = \frac{1}{2} \times E(W-1) + \frac{1}{2} \times (E(W+1) - E(W+L)) + 1 - \frac{1}{L+1} \times (E(W+1) - E(W+L))
\]

This equation, starting from \(G\) and \(G+(L+1)\), allows us to calculate \(E(W)\) for all \(W\) and then find \(E(W)\) for our specific \(W\). It concatenates that \(E(W)\) and \(E(W+L)\) grow by \(1\) on each side until they meet.

Given the nature of the problem, we take advantage of the probabilistic methods applied to different weight configurations.

If the target weight \(G + L < W\): direct result would be impossible, answer is \(-1\) (or corresponding modulo output).

If \(G \leq W \leq G + L\):

Subtlety in \(L\) modifies the basic "gambler's ruin" principle. When not exceeding target + L is a restriction, we can analytically solve the problem.

Utilize a state machine (or DP) where the states are weights and transitions are days.

The problem is effectively modeled as:
1. Transfer/State matrix \(T\) that describes transitions from weight \(w\) to \(w-1\) and \(w+1\) with constraints.
2. Initial state \(v_0\) vector that starts at \(w=W\).
3. Solve recurrence by raising \(T\) to appropriate power to find probabilities of reaching \(G\).

After solving the aforementioned problem for the transition matrix, probabilities are integrated over and mod \(998{,}244{,}353\) is applied to \(p/q\) ratio and the inverse of \(q\).

For the implementation, you would first set up the transition probabilities and solve for expected number of steps via a method such as matrix exponentiation followed by modular inverses. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 998244353;

typedef long long ll;

    int n = A.size();
    vector<vector<ll>> C(n, vector<ll>(n));

        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            for(int k = 0; k < n; ++k)
                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j] % MOD) % MOD;
    return C;
}

vector<vector<ll>> pow_matrix(vector<vector<ll>>& A, ll p) {
    int n = A.size();
    vector<vector<ll>> res(n, vector<ll>(n));
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) res[i][i] = 1;
    while (p > 0) {
        if (p & 1) res = multiply(res, A);
        p >>= 1;
        A = multiply(A, A);
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        ll W, G, L;
        cin >> W >> G >> L;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": ";
        if (W < G + L) {
            if (G >= W) cout << W - G << endl;
            else cout << "0" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << -1 << endl; // Impossible case
        }
    }
}
```
Above implementation provides a basic framework. Exact probabilistic results would rely on detailed matrix exponentiation with proper handling of modular arithmetic and possibly submatrix calculations respecting \(L\)-restriction.

We can reduce this to a simpler dynamic programming problem. Since we are only concerned with difference in weight \(D\) and the limiting factor \(L\), we can solve the problem of the expected days based on this difference \(D = W - G\), utilizing dynamic programming where each state \(dp[d]\) represents the expected number of days until we get from \(d\) to zero. The transitions essentially comply with the chance of a day being either a reduction or an increase in \(d\) by 1 unit, unless \(D \leq L\), in which we won't ever increase \(D\). 

We leverage the following key formula for transitions:
\[dp[d] \leftarrow \frac{(2 \times \mathit{dp}[d - 1] + 1) \cdot dp[d + 1] - dp[d]}{dp[d + 1] + dp[d - 1] - 2 \cdot dp[d]}\]

- If \(D \leq L\) (with weight limit constraint into account), reduce \(D\) by $1$ each day on average until reaching \(G\)
- Otherwise, each day, \(D\) reduces by $1$ (either you gain and then lose weight or you simply lose weight) with a similar transition but needs to accommodate the $1/u$ factor which balances out each state.

The code initializes the solution within these constraints, applying inverse modular arithmetic for final output consistency.

Your current weight is \(W\), and you aim for \(G < W\). Each day, your weight changes by \(+1\) or \(-1\) with even chances. However, you adhere strictly to a rule: if your weight has ever been \(w\), you'll never exceed \(w + L\) in the future. If gaining 1 unit would breach this rule, you’ll ensure a weight loss of 1 unit. With these conditions, the goal is to determine the expected number of days to reach \(G\) weight, expressed as a modular multiplicative inverse of two integers.

Recall that on each day, your weight changes either up or down with equal probability, unless such an adjustment would lead you to exceed your personal maximum allowable weight. This gives rise to a recurrence relation for the expected days to reach weight \(G\) from any given \(w\). Here's a high-level overview of the solution:

1. **Define State Variable:** Define \(D(w)\) as the expected number of days to reach \(G\) from weight \(w\).
2. **Base Case:** If \(w = G\), \(D(G) = 0\).
3. **Transitional Rules:**
    - For \(w \leq G + L\), \(D(w) = 1 + 0.5 \cdot (D(w-1) + D(w+1))\) if \(w > G\).
    - For \(w = G + L + 1\), \(D(w) = 1 + 0.5 \cdot D(w-1)\).
4. **Recursion/Memoization for Large Inputs:** This step simplifies to updating each \(D(W)\) using previous values given overlapping subproblems.
5. **Matrix Exponentiation or Iterative Calculation:** Lastly, efficiently compute expected times by either repeated matrix powering or iterative summation of recursive calls.

    long long n = dW + (L * (dW <= L));

The problem can be approached by decomposing it into sub-problems that allow a dynamic programming solution. Let's define a function \(d(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \ldots, \Lambda_k)\) where the combined $\Lambda$ can be split into the sum of some integer parts. 

If \(G = W-1\) and \(L = 0\), then it takes exactly \(W-1\) days to reach \(G\).

Suppose we take the first step. Then, we can move to a situation modeled by \(d(\Lambda_1, \ldots, \Lambda_i - 1, \ldots, \Lambda_k)\), which is our subproblem. Due to symmetry, we can express this as a probability problem (since each day, with equal likelihood, we move up or down by 1) and thus cast into expectations.

With \(F_{n,k,b}\) defined as the number of steps needed to move under our constraints with \(n\) steps left and \(k\) parts remaining, we handle the initial conditions with specific values:

\[ F_{n,k,0} = n \]
If we start with a decrease:

\[ F_{n,k,1} = F_{n-1, k, 0} + F_{n-1,k,1} + n \] which can be simplified in a DP fashion.

We aim to find \(d(\Lambda) = F_{\Lambda - 1, k}\).

This recursive relation can be memoized to avoid redoing work. For the larger \(L\) and higher \(998,244,353\)-modulus outputs, the expected days are computed recursively based on subproblems and the probability distribution.

- \(W\) and \(L\) can be up to \(10^{18}\), so exact calculations can overflow
- \(T \leq 90\)
- \(1 \leq G \lt W\)
- Overall computation should be efficient to handle large inputs

# Faster Calculation:
To calculate expected number of days, the basic idea is to use a recursive approach where \(E(x)\) is the expected number of days to go from \(x\) to \(G\).

- \[E(x) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + E(x-1)) + \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + E(x+1))\]

- Subtracting \(x\) from the LIM infers a state of lower limit \(LIM - x\) is effortful.

-Due to symmetry and considering forbidding cross-over past LIM:

1. With no upper constraint (\(L\) large), \(E(x)\) grows linearly with \(x\). Formula: \(E(x) = (x - G) + \frac{1}{2}E(x + 1)\).

2. When upper constraint applies, \(E(x)\) can be computed using an offset \(LIM=\min(W + L, G + L + 1)\) to limit overgrowth allowed due to past maxima. Now, \(E(x)\) is a harmonic sequence moderated considering \(x \geq G\) reducing to \(E(x)\).

3. Precompute \(E(W)\) and adjust for \(G .sim(\text{offset from initialization}).\]

</tags>

To solve this, we'll start by computing the number of days to go from \(W\) to \(W-1\) since now going to limit denotes moving backwards, following the recursive structure. The effect of \(L\) constraint can be handled efficiently with precomputed harmonic bounds. Given modulo requirement, inverses might be precomputed.

# Recursive relationships
Let \( f(i, j) \) denote the expected number of steps to reach \( G \) from weight \( i \) with a lowest weight weight of \( L_j \).

The constraints on the weight can be broken into several cases for recursive relation:
- Weight is greater than \( G \)- no advantage in decreasing if not violating the limit.
- Weight is lower than \(G\) by more than \( L \)- one can decrease weight to \( G \) but not necessarily get closer towards the next decrease due to the restriction.
- Weight is between \( G-L \) and \( G \)- a decreasing weight is advantageous here.
- Weight equals \( G \) - no steps required to reach \( G\).

The recursion for \( f(i, j) \) is as follows:
\[ f(i, j) = \begin{cases} 
  1, & \text{if } i = G, \\
  2f(i-1, j) & \text{if } i - j > L, \\
  1 + \frac{1}{2} f(i-1, j) + \frac{1}{2} f(i+1, \max(j, i)), & \text{otherwise}. 
\end{cases} \]

To solve for total number of steps, we apply dynamic programming. Given the large bounds for \(W\) and \(L\), we can solve using matrix exponentiation for efficiency.

If $W - L \geq G$, it's impossible to reach $G$ under the weight constraint, so the answer is $-1$.

If $L = 0$, the expected time to reach $G$ is simply the distance from $W$ to $G$, since the weight can't increase.

Use dynamic programming on $X$, the difference between your weight and your lowest recorded weight. The expected time $A(X)$ to reach $G$ when starting at weight $W$ depends on $X$.

We'll use a map $A[X]$ to store the expected days to reach $G$ when starting at weight $X$ relative to the lowest recorded max. We'll start by setting the expected times at the constraints $A[W-L] = 0$ and $A[G-W] = W-G$.

Then for each possible weight $X$ we recursively update all possible values, starting with $X = 0$ and increasing up to $W-L$:

\[A[X] = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (A[X-1] + \min(A[X + 1], X + L - X))\]

The precomputed values for $A[x]$ help speed up the process. The right-hand side simplifies to $1 + \frac{1}{2}(A[X-1] + X + L)$

You currently weigh \(W\) units and wish to achieve \(G\) units, with a strict limit \(L\). Each day, you can either increase or decrease your weight by 1 unit. However, once you reach a weight \(w\), you must ensure it never exceeds \(w + L\) in the future. Calculate the average number of days until you reach \(G\), expressed as \(p/q\). The result is computed as \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353\), where \(q^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of \(q\).

To solve, we base on \(G < W\) and \(L\). When \(L = 0\), it's straightforward if \(G < W\). Otherwise, we compute weight dynamics, considering strict stopping condition. Use dynamic programming (DP) for optimal solution.

<observation>If \(L = 0\), the maximum possible weight you can reach is \(W\), hence you can only succeed reaching \(G\) if \(G < W\). The solution simplifies significantly.</observation>

In summary, we need a dynamic programming approach, but only if \(L > 0\) to handle weight restrictions, and otherwise, a simple check suffices when \(L = 0\).

If \(L = 0\) and \(G < W\), the solution is \(W - G\).

If \(L > 0\), we need to construct a DP function where we iterate from \(G\) up to \(G + L\) and track the expected days needed to reach \(G\) for each intermediate state.

If your weight increases or decreases by 1 unit each day, with equal probability, and you cannot exceed your maximum allowable weight, \(W + L\), it is desired to find the average number of days to reach weight \(G\) by iterating with your own set constraints. Each test starts with a unique \(W\), \(G\), and \(L\) to represent the present weight, ideal weight, and maximum allowable weight increment respectively. After reaching the desired weight, results should follow modulo \( 998,244,353\).

<paraphrased>
Given initial weight \(W\), goal weight \(G < W\), and maximum allowable increase \(L\), determine the average number of days to reach \(G\) weight, where daily weight could increase or decrease by \(1\) unit with equal likelihood._constraint and no weight can exceed the weight at any point plus \(L\).

Days are counted until weight is \(G\), and the average number of days, expressed as \(p/q\) in lowest terms, must be provided as \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \( 998{,}244{,}353 \)). 

Example: When weight \( = 201\), goal \( = 200\), and max increase \( = 1\), there is a \(1/2\) probability of losing one unit on the first day, a \(1/4\) probability of gaining then losing one unit, and so forth, thus the average days \(= 3\). If the max allowable increase in weight were 0, it would take exactly \( 201 - 200 = 1 \) day to reach \( 200 \) units.

*On days you could be at weight \(W\), calculate the expected day as a transition from a lower state \(x = w - 1, w - 2,\dots\).
*Each state has two relevant outcomes (gain or lose weight), making their expected day difference \(1/2\) each.
*The transitions are recursive with one call for the transition (lose weight) and indirect call for the win state since it goes further down.

# Small Explanation
We aim to find an optimal path, similar to the idea of a geometric random walk on a line, with some constraints. With our initial condition at \(W\) weight units, we seek to eventually reach \(G\). At any state \(x\), the expected day to reach \(G\) is the sum of the expected days from state \(x-1\) and any higher states that constrain stepping downwards from our ceiling \(W+L\) to move towards our goal \(G\).

We employ a recursive dynamic programming formula where for any weight \(x\), the expected days to goal \(G\) can be expressed as:
\[
E[x] = 1 + \frac{E[x - 1] + E[\min(\max(x + 1, G), W + L)]}{2}.
\]

If the weight reaches \(W + L\), there are no higher states to decide from (since it cannot go beyond this). Our stopping criteria is hitting \(G\) which ends the recursion. Since we aim to find the average day count modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \), we use modular inverse for division. The answer is \( E[W] \) modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) where the result aligns our recurring calculations within stated limitations.

# Implementation

To solve, iteratively apply the recursive DP approach, noting the states that allow us to reach the goal weight via transitions are intricately linked. 

```python
MOD = 998244353

def mod_inverse(n):
    # Compute the modular inverse of x under MOD
    return pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)

def solve(W, G, L):
    # Dynamic programming array to store expected days to reach G
    dp = [0] * (W + L + 1)
    # Iterate backwards 
    for x in range(W + L - 1, max(W, G), -1):
        dp[x] = (1 + (dp[x-1] + dp[min(x + 1, W + L)]) % MOD) // 2 % MOD
    # Answer based on starting weight W
    ans = (dp[W] * mod_inverse(2))

Define an array \( \text{dp}[w] \) where \( \text{dp}[w] \) is the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from \( w \). Denote \(  \text{floor}(w) = \max(G + 1 - |L|, w) \) as the smallest possible weight we can't go below without hitting the L limit. Our target becomes computing \( \text{dp}[W] \). 

Let \( f(w) = \text{dp}[w-1] - \text{dp}[w] \). Note:
\[ \text{dp}[w] = 1 +  \frac{1}{2} * (\text{dp}[w-1] + \text{dp}[w+1] ) - \frac{1}{2} * \mathbb{1}_{w > G+L} * \text{dp}[G+L+1] \]

Therefore, 
\[ f(w) = f(w - 1) - \mathbb{1}_{w > G+L} (f(G + L) + 2) \]

Starting from the target being \( G \), set \( \text{dp}[G] = 0 \) and \( dp[G + 1] = 1 \). Now, applying the function \( f \) forwards, we fill \( dp \) from \( dp[G + 2] \) to \(dp[W] \).

For a weight \( w \), if \( \text{dp}[w] \) precedes G, \( f(w+1) \) is zero. Otherwise, an expression for \( f(w+1) \) in terms \( f(w) \) can be written accounting for the constraint.

Precalculating these \( f \) values takes \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) time per weight, for the entire weight range. From there, we can use \( f \) values to calculate each dp given the constraint \(L\):

\[ \text{dp}[W] = \sum_{i=0}^{W-G} f( W - i - \min(L, W-G) ) \]

As long as the elements in \( f \) are computed once and subsequently re-used, we perform this summation in \(\mathcal{O}(1)\). The time complexity is dominated by the \(\mathcal{O}(W-G) \) term required to step through all the weights —which is linear in space and sub-exponential in time.

</observation>
<observations>
<observation>This is an expectation problem. Typical analysis of expectation problems on cases can be very complex. Instead, we will use the method of generating functions (GF). We are interested in \(E_i\), the expected number of days it takes to go from weight \(i\) to \(G\) (under the given constraints).</observation>
<observation>The GF of a sequence \(a_0, a_1, \ldots a_N\) is \(A(x) = \sum_{i=0}^N a_i x^i\), which "encodes" the sequence \(a_i\). Suppose we have a sequence where the terms satisfy the linear recurrence \(a_{i+1} = c_0 a_{i} + c_1 a_{i - 1} + \ldots c_n a_{i - n}\) (with appropriate initialization of \(a_i\)). We can then "shift" the GF by multiplying by \(x\), so we get \(x A(x) = c_0 A(x) + c_1 x A(x) + \ldots c_n x^n A(x)\). If we move the terms \(xkA(x)\) to the left side and remaining to the right, we get a rational GF of the form \(A(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\).</observation>
<observation>This can be solved with partial fractions and computed through an arithmetico-geometric or geometric sum, ending up as a more friendly recurrence. Note the mechanic of this solution is to use two recurrences, one which computes the weights and one which computes \(E_i\).</observation>
<observation>This problem has case analysis on the relative values of \(W\), \(G\) and \(L\). We get totally four cases, and not all pairs \(i, j\) so that \(i + j = G\) can lead to a weight decrease. Given constraints, we set the appropriate recurrences and use a formula based on that.</observation>
<observation>Since we're asked to print \(p \cdot q^{-1}\), where \(\frac{p}{q}\) is the expected value in lowest terms, we compute \(p, q\) from the GF formula and use the inverse of \(q\) using the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is faster than brute-force modular exponentiation.</observation>

The key insight here is to use generating functions to transform the problem into a linear recurrence, which gives us a more tractable approach to compute the expected number of days:

1. **Generating Function Approach**:
   - Let \(E_i\) denote the expected number of days to go from weight \(i\) to \(G\).
   - Constructing a generating function for the sequence \(E_i\), we find relationships between adjacent terms which can be expressed as a linear recurrence.

2. **Constraint Considerations**:
   - There are four cases to consider based on the relative values of \(W\), \(G\), and \(L\):
     1. \(G = W - 1\)
     2. \(G = W > L\)
     3. \(G = W \le L\)
     4. \(G < W, W \le L + G\)
     5. \(G < W, W > L + G\)
3. **Expected Value Recurrence**:
   - Based on the difference between \(W, G\) for constraints, set up recurrences to handle transitions between weights.
   - For different cases, we end up with different final results.
   
4. **GF Resolution**:
   - The goal is converting GF component, using partial fraction decomposition to extract a regular recurrence for computing \(E_i\).
   - With linear recurrence result, direct compute the expectations for all \(i\) until \(E_G\).
   
5. **Modular Inverse**:
   - Upon determination of \(p, q\) from the calculated formula, find \(q^{-1}\) using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

# Explanation

Let's use an iterative dynamic-programming (DP) algorithm where the state is defined as (\(w, h\)), denoting the expected number of days to achieve \(G\) starting from weight \(w\) and having previously maximized at \(w + h\). We define the base case for the DP table as:

\[ \text{dp}(G, L) = 0 \]

Or more accurately, since \(w\) is compared relative to \(G\) and \(h\) affects allowed heights, we do dynamic planning in deltas by \(w - G\) and \(h\). 

For any given state \(\text{dp}(k, h)\):

\[ \text{dp}(k, h) = 0.5 \cdot (\text{dp}(\max(k - 1, h - L), h) + \text{dp}(\min(k + 1, h), h - 1) + 1) \]

We avoid recursion and calculate the DP table iteratively for different \(k\) and \(h\). With large limits of \(W\) and \(L\), vector \(a\) stores \(\text{dp}\) entries by flipping \(h\) off to negative weights.

We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the expected number of days to reach a weight of $G$ with a given weight $w$ and limit $L$. Define $dp[i]$ as the expected number of days to get from weight $i$ units to $G$ units, for $G \le i \le W + L$. 

Then for each $i$, $dp[i]$ can be calculated as:

\[
dp[i] {\buildrel\over=}\frac{1}{2} dp[i - 1] + \frac{1}{2} dp[i + 1]
\]
When $i = G$,
\[
dp[G] = 0
\]
Meanwhile, if $i = L + G$, the fact that we can't increase your weight makes $\frac{1}{2} dp[i + 1]$ drop off, while when $i = G$, it drops off the negative term of $\frac{1}{2} dp[i-1]$ instead because at that point, the limit doesn't matter. 

This pattern continues every second array entry as the limit gets stricter. Specifically, for each $i = L + G + 2k$ where $k \ge 0$, the left or right term $\frac{1}{2} dp[i - 1]$ or $\frac{1}{2} dp[i + 1]$ drops away.

By a well-known formula, fractional arithmetic and not bubbling variables out of order, we can work out that:
\[
dp[G + 1] = 2
\]
\[
dp[G + 2] = 4, dp[G] = 0 = 2\cdot2 - 4, ...
\]
\[
dp[2G] = (2G - 1)^2
\]

For general $i$:
\[
dp[i] = (2(i - G) - 1)^2
\]

Just solve it in reverse order, and when we finish with $dp[W]$, output that score and the effective denominator of $2^{N}$ and find $p \times q^{-1}$ mod $998{,}244{,}353$, and verify that $q$ is a power of $2$.

Use dynamic programming (\(DP\)) to tackle this problem. Let \(dp[x]\) denote the expected number of days to reach \(G\) from weight \(x\).

### Initial Boundary Conditions:
- \(dp[G] = 0\): You’ve already reached your goal.

### Recursive Formulation:
- If \(x \geq W\), \(dp[x] = W-x\): You can only lose weight. No choices needed.
- Other cases are more nuanced and must be considered separately depending on constraints.

### Transitioning:
To establish transitions, you factor in the probabilistic nature of each day's changes affecting \(dp[x]\):

- **If \(x > G\) and \(G < x \leq W\)**: You can either gain or lose a day without constraint bumps.
    - \(dp[x] = 1 + \frac{dp[x-1] + dp[x+1]}{2}\)

- **Case for \(x = W\)**: here we run a similar check, but adhere to the absolute maximum based on \(W + L\).
    - For all \(x\), if \(x \leq W - L\), we could potentially increase to \(W\):
        - \(dp[x] = 1 + dp[x-1]\)
    - For the remaining weights:
        - \(dp[x] = 1 + \frac{dp[x-1]}{2}\)

Handling the above requires careful attention, especially to avoid several states becoming TBINGO (too big in number of operations).

### Inverting and Modular Arithmetic:
Use a matrix \(A\) to represent transitions and ensure operations stick within modular bounds, particularly for handling large numbers. Trivialization is achieved using modular exponentiation to compute powers of matrices.

## Pseudocode for Computational Approach:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 988244353;

long long weight_LogMod(long long w, long long p, long long mod = MOD) {
    // Implement modular exponentiation
    long long res = 1;
    while(p > 0){
        if(p & 1) res = (res * w) % MOD;
        w = (w * w) % MOD;
        p >>= 1;

    return ans;
}

    vector<vector<long long>> ans(base.size(), vector<long long>(base.size()));

        if(exp & 1) ans = ans * base;

Let’s start by decomposing \(W\) into geometrically varying intervals:

If the current lowest weight is \(w_{min}\), and the goal weight is \(G\), let's settle the expectation to decrease from \(w_{min}+i\) to \(w_{min}+i-1\) for \(i = 1, 2, ..., L\) plus the remaining weight to reach \(G\).

The number of days to reach a new minimal threshold \(w_{min} - i\) is proportional to \(i\): \((w_{min} - G + i) \cdot \text{exps()} \approx (w_{min} - G + i)\). Summing this up, we get approximately \(\sum_{i=1}^{L} (w_{min} - G + i)\).

Reducing this recursively let’s denote \(W = gw + K\) and \(w_{min} = K + L\), the problem splits into

- Two separate random walks: one from \(gw\) to \(gw-1\) units (this takes \(gw\) days on average),
- and one that's a reduced version of the entire problem, but with \(K\) remaining to get from \(gw-g + K + L\) to \(gw-g + K\).

Using a recurrence relation could be challenging due to handling large values up to \(10^{18}\), so it’s better to formulate expected number of steps algebraically, where:

- Initial configuration: \((w_{min} = W-L, G, L)\)
- Separate into two steps whenever \(L > G\).

The exact formula for the expected number of days would incorporate the harmonic series for distributions that are not just integer values (with large values fast-decaying probability).

Let \(E(W, G, L)\) represents the expected number of days it would take to reach \(G\) from \(W\):

\[
E(W, G, L) = W - G + \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{(W-G)^2}{2i}
\]

The above formula is only accurate for substantial parts as \(W, G, L \le 10^{18}\). Implement the series sum part separately:

Considering the transition function as is may lead to complexity issues due to large values. To make it feasible, break the problem into subproblems solely based on the differences between \(W\) and \(G\) and ignoring the constant weight \(W\) itself, reducing the state space to only two parameters.

The relationship \( E[W, G, L] = \cfrac{1}{2} \times \left ( 1 + E[W - 1, G, L-2] + E[W+1, G, L] \right ) \) motivates us to reframe it as a recurrence relation in difference terms: \( dp(x, l) = \cfrac{1}{2} \left ( 1 + dp(x-1,l) + dp(x+1, l-2) \right ) \).

To compute this efficiently and handle the constraints, we recognize this as a linear recurrence relation, for which there are efficient numerical algorithms. By representing the solution to \( dp \) functions with a matrix \( M \) where each row represents a different term of the recurrence and each column represents a different value for \( l \), we can efficiently compute using matrix exponentiation. Note each \( dp \) transformation can be seen as multiplying a vector by the transition matrix \( M \).

The dimensions of the matrix will grow as we iterate through larger values of \( x \) and \( l \), but importantly – the matrix only needs to expand by the range of \( x \).

Examples:

If \( L = 0 \), all days above weight \( G \) immediately convert their weight to \( G \), so the problem should collapse to the same result as if \( L = 0 \).

```
Case 2: x (W - G) is 1, l (L) is 1, dp(1, 1) = 2
```

When L = 0 or G = W, the process becomes simpler, as all weight transitions beyond \( G \) do not contribute to \( dp \).

We need to solve the recurrence efficiently and determine \( dp(W - G, L) \), then compute \( dp(W - G, L) \mod 998,244,353 \).

Finally, we convert the fraction \( p/q \) to the required format mod 998,244,353, taking \( q^{-1} \) as the modular inverse.

Let \(dp[i]\) denote the expected days required to reach weight \(G\) starting from weight \(i\).

For \(i = G\):
\[dp[G] = 0\]
because you already hit the desired weight.

For \(i = G + 1\):
\[dp[G + 1] = 1\]
since you are one step above your target and will take one day’s worth of steps back to reach \(G\).

For general \(i\), either above, at, or below \(G\):
- if \(i \leq G\), the expected transition probabilities are halved,
\[dp[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(dp[i-1] + dp[i+1])\]
otherwise, if \(i\) is above \(G\) and within \(L\) units,
\[dp[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(dp[i-1] + dp[i+1])\]
For higher values \(i > G + L\), transitions only reduce,
\[dp[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(dp[i-1])\]

With the DP solution, you compute towards \(W\) iteratively (or recursively) using memoization to avoid recomputation.

Finally, \(dp[W] \bmod 998244353\) gives the required result.

Using matrix exponentiation is the key to solving this problem efficiently. We first need to express the recursive formula for \(E(w)\) given by the problem in matrix form. The recursive formula, with boundary conditions and the fact that you can't exceed \(w + L\), can be written as:

\[ E(w+1) = 2E(w) - E(w-1) + 2 \]

Both \(E(w-1)\) and \(E(w+1)\) can be expressed in terms of \(E(W - 1)\) or the boundary condition \(E(G)\). Thus, to solve this, we can use a matrix to represent the system of equations and then exponentiate this matrix to the necessary number of times.

To make the following code efficient, we will use Python’s SymPy library to handle modular arithmetic required for matrix exponentiation and other computations.

<paraphrased>
You start at weight \(W\) and aim to reach \(G\) units, where \(G < W\). Each day, your weight increases or decreases by \(1\) unit with equal probability. However, once you've reached weight \(w\), you cannot exceed \(w + L\). The challenge is to calculate the average number of days until you reach \(G\) units, expressed as \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \(998,244,353\)).

In general, we aim to average the sum of the expected number of days it will take to get from each possible current weight \(i\) (where \(G \leq i \leq \max(G, W)\)) to \(G\):

\[ \sum_{i = G}^{W} (E[i] + \frac{E[i -1]}{2} + \frac{E[i + 1]}{2}) \]

This equation includes the cost of reaching \(i\) itself \(E[i]\), and the expected time for both possible next moves, each halving the probability. The edge condition is:

- If the current weight is \(w\), it takes \((L + 1)^2\) days on average to return to \(w\) when the weight cap \(w + L\).
- If \(i \geq w + L\), the expected number of days for decreasing to \(w + L - 1\) is \((L+ 1)^2\) days.

For \(i < max(W, G)\), we use a dynamic programming approach to compute the expected number of days:

If \(i < w + L\):

- There’s a \(1/2\) probability of increasing, costing \(E[i+1] + 1\) days.
- There’s a \(1/2\) probability of decreasing to \(i-1\), costing \(E[i-1] + 1\) days.

Thus:

\[E[i] = E[i-1]*(1/2) + E[i+1]*(1/2) + 1\]

Solving this system, \(E[i]\) grows quadratically.

Edge conditions:
- For \(i \lt G\), \(E[i] = E[i + 1] + 1\).
- For known \(i \gt \max(W, G)\), \(E[i] = E[i-1] + 1\).

Ultimately, the days until \(G\) is found in terms of \(\max(G, W)\):

If \(W > G\), directly compute days by \(W - G\).
Otherwise, the key weight is \(\max(G, W)\) for the dynamic programming approach. Expected days \(E[\max(G, W)]\) can computed with the above logic, given the weight cap \(L\).

# Constraints Verification:
Given limits, this calculation fit within the temporal restraints through binary search for cubic computations.

# Implementation

We use dynamic programming to solve the expected number of days. For each weight \(i\) between \(G\) and \(\max(G, W)\), we calculate the expected number of days to reach \(G\).

An important detail is to precompute \((L+1)^2\) for faster computations.

Let \(dp[i]\) represent the expected steps to \(G\) from \(i\). If \(i > G\), this will be \(dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i+1] + 2\). If \(i\) is the immediate constraint, set \(dp[i] = 0\).

To get an average of the number of days it takes to get from weight W down to G, we need to calculate the expected values. If \(L \geq (W - G)\), that means we can use monotonicity: the only limit is that we can't go above W, but starting from W, with equal probabilities, we will always go down to G. Thus, the number of days is simply \(A = G + W - 1\). In this case, we can perform modulo arithmetic using modular inverses for output.

Otherwise, let's compute our values for small \(L\) using a dynamic programming approach. Let \(DP[i][w]\) represent the expected number of days we need to expect to reach weight \(G\), having seen a minimum of \(i\) already from some weight \(w\). 

Then we have:
\[ DP[i][w] = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} DP[i][w - 1] + \frac{1}{2} DP[i + (w - i - 1)][w + 1] \right) \]
Where \(DP[i][w + 1] = \infty\) if \(w + 1 > i + L\).

We initialize with the base case: \(DP[0][G] = 0\), as reaching \(G\) from \(G\) takes \(0\) days on average.

Once we precompute some values, we can run a simple binary search over \(L\) to compute the answer using monotonicity.

Putting all these pieces together leads to a constant time solution, since $L$ is bounded by $10^{18}$.

We can see that \(GEF\) satisfies a linear recurrence in which each term is completely determined by the two next terms. It is always a linear combination of two linear basis functions, a constant and an identity transformation function. WLOG, let's assume that decreasing weight is twice as likely as increasing weight resulting in expected days \(GEF_{1:1}(W)\) taken to reach \(G\) with equal up and down probability. Following this logic, we can compute the expected days \(aM-bD\) as in which \(M\) is the number of up moves, \(D\) is the number of down moves, and \(a\) and \(b\) are constant. For \(GEF_{1:1}(W)\), we have \(a = 0\) and \(b = 1\).

Once we get a general expression for \(GEF_{a:b}(W)\) with this process, we can return \(GEF_{1:1}(W)\) if \(L\) is 0, then derive \(a\) and \(b\) for \(GEF_{a:b}(W)\) by calculating with a computational method. For \(L \neq 0\), this computational method from above is derived to be:

\[ a = \frac{2W - 2G + L - 1}{2(L + 1)} \]
\[ b = \frac{2W - 2G - L - 1}{2(L + 1)} \]

 knowing this, we can derive the following conclusion: the expected time to reach \(G\) is \(GEF(W) = (W - G)(a + b) = W - G - (L + 1)\) days. 

Thus, the closest integer value of the solution can be returned as follows:

\[ p = W - G - (L + 1) \]
\[ q = 1 \]

To solve the problem, we can simplify and transform weights to slots, and then perform recursive calculations on those slots using dynamic programming. This approach considers transitions between states, where each state represents a current weight and the number of times the constraint \(L\) has been used. We compute the needed operations modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) and use a modular inverse to find the normalized probability.

To provide a concise algorithm:
1. Normalize weights \(0 \leq i < W-G\)
2. Use dynamic programming with states \( dp_{i,j} \), where \( i \) is the current weight adjusted, \( j \) is number of "used" \(L\) slots hit.
3. Process the next possible states from \(dp_{i,j}\) averaging out toward each feasible next day and checking constraints.
4. Initialize final day boundary as \(dp_{0,0}\) with an implicit infinite path for uncomputed states.
5. Compute the expected value while managing weights above \(0\).

The objective is to determine the average number of days it will take to reach \(G\), expressed as \(p \times q^{-1}\) modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

<constraint_analysis>
Since the values of \(W\) and \(L\) can be up to \(10^{18}\), the solution can't be a straightforward iterative one. We can neither afford \(10^{18}\) operations nor the memory required.

Note the answer is involved in a ratio \(p/q\).

\(q\) must be as small as possible to avoid overflow. And since we must output the quantity as an inverse modulo, \(q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353\) has to be efficiently calculated.

The big constraint involves \(W\). This size of value requires mathematical transformation because there is no workaround for speed or memory.

<observations>
<observation>Using expected value equations, if you start at weight \(X\), with \(L\) limit, the expected number of days to reach \(G\) units is \(e(X)\). We can form the recurrence relation \(e(X) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (e(X-1) + e(min(X+1, X+L)))\) for \(G < X <= W\).</observation>
<observation>Pay attention to edge cases: if \(W = G + 1\), it’s the one day only to lose. If \(L = 0\) as illustrated in the fourth case, then it’s inarguable linear number of days.</observation>
<observation>The answer could end up in a fraction where the denominator could be large. So, we need to express the answer in the form of modular inverses.</observation>
<observation>The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization. However, this can be optimized by noting that the answer for any \(X\) only depends on \(X-1, X\), and some intermediate values of \(X+1\) up to \(X+L\).</observation>

Let \(e(x)\) be the expected number of days to lose \(x|W-G|\) units of weight. 

We have base cases:

- \(e(0) = 0\): if our weight is exactly \(W\) and our goal is \(G = W-0\) units, we've made it already. It takes zero days.
- \(e(1) = 1\): if our weight is \(W-1\), it's a matter of one day for sure, do not deviate.

The recursive case can be written as

\[
e(x+1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}e(x) + \frac{1}{2}e(min(x+1, L))
\]

since after one day, you'll either gain and take \(e(x)\) expected days to get back, or you'll exceed the limit and force yourself to one guaranteed loss, taking \(\frac{1}{2}e(min(x+1, L))\) expected days total.

Using these recurrence relations, we build the entire DP table up to \(L\) (it's unnecessary to go higher). We are interested in \(E = e(W-G)\).

With some care, this approach reduces the size of optimization problems into smaller subproblems. Regarding the modulus and inverses, we must be careful to handle any divisions by modular inverses of the mod. We will need an efficient way to calculate the modular inverse and to compute the fractions of the expected values.

First, let's calculate the expected number of days without the constraint \(L\):

We have the following dynamic programming formula without \(L\):
\[ 
E_i = 1 + 0.5E_{i-1} + 0.5E_{i+1} 
\]
which simplifies to:
\[ 
E_i = 2 + E_{i-1} - E_{i-2} 
\]

We know the base cases \(E(G) = 0\) and for \(i < G - L\), \(E_i = L\).

Now, let's account for the constraint \(L\). Define that \(E_i = 2 + E_{i-1}\) if a gain was made with probability \(p(L)\) for \(i > G - L\), where:
\[ 
p(L) = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{2}{L+1}\right)^{G-i}
\]

Finally, calculate the expected number of days accounting for \(L\) dynamically, adjusting for the overuse probabilities.

# Implementation
We need a simulation approach as \(W\) and \(L\) can be up to \(10^{18}\). We compute everything in \(O(W - G + L)\). We will use a memoization strategy to avoid redundant computations.

      if (w <= G) return 0;
      
      LL& cache = memo[w];
      if (cache != -1) return cache;

      LL p = 1 - pow(1 - (2LL) / (l + 1LL), G - w + 1LL);
      LL val = 2LL + f(w - 1LL, l - (p == 1) * (l == 1)) + (p - 1) * f(w - 2LL, l - 1LL);
      cache = (val % M);
      return cache;

You aim to reduce your weight from \( W \) to \( G \) units over time. Every day, your weight increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal likelihood unless constrained by a past weight limit \( L \). There are potentially three key weights: \( W \), \( G \), and \( H \) which is the highest weight where you can enforce a limit. You set a new weight limit \( H = e + L \) when you reach a weight \( e \).

The expected days to travel from \( a \) to \( b \) without any restrictions \( F(a, b) \) can be determined by using a recursive formula. However, given the constraint limit, you need to carefully vary the steps to avoid exceeding the bounds.

- If \( b + L \le a \), you must guarantee weight loss every day until \( b \)
- You continue to move between \( b + L \) and \( b \)
- Else, you recursively use the expected steps to move from \( a \) to \( b \)

The problem resembles a random walk with the lower bound fixed at \(G\) and the upper bound dynamically varying from \(W\) to some end-limit. We need to compute the expected number of days to reach \(G\), considering the constraint.

We use dynamic programming to precompute expected days to move from weight x to y, under the restriction. Given Weight-Hit till \(e\), you have upper-limit as \(e + L\), so this fixes your journey bounds for each new limit until \(H\).

The DP states address weights \(x, y, z\) given constraints \(x > y > z\), \((x - y)(y - z) > 0\). Precompute values for \(F(x, y)\), which is time to move between \(x\) and \(y\) without hitting limits.

For movement between fixed weights, the recurrence relation looks like:
\[ F(x, y) = 1 + (F(x-1, y) + F(x, y-1) + F(x+1, y) + F(x, y+1)) / 2 \]

When the weight \(H \leq G + L\), the recursive computation simplifies, and you make direct jumps from G to H consistently due to weight constraints avoiding extra random movements.

The modulo operation is applied continuously during modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow.

Consider an individual currently at weight $W$, aiming to reach an ideal weight $G<G$ units, where $G$ is strictly less than $W$. Each day, the person’s weight changes by +1 or -1 unit randomly. However, they enforce a rule that their weight should never exceed their peak weight $w + L$ from any previous day.

The problem is to calculate the expected (average) number of days until reaching the desired weight $G$. The final output should be the number of days expressed as $p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353$, where $q^{-1}$ is the modular multiplicative inverse of $q$ modulo $998{,}244{,}353$ and $p/q$ is in lowest terms.

Exact constraints and possible solutions include:
- Since weight changes are random, and you will always drop if you would climb above your highest weight $w+L$, the trajectory is dynamic.
- $W \geq G$ ensures you always have a direction (decreasing).
- $L$ constrains the peak weight, which means you will always push down if you exceed this peak.
- For very small ranges, recursion and memoization are handy; for larger ranges, recognizing patterns or applying optimizations becomes necessary.
- The value of $L$ can be large, such as $10^{18}$, thus efficient algorithms avoiding large loops are needed.

The problem revolves around calculating an expected value problem under constraints, calling for a combination of mathematical insights and potentially dynamic programming techniques.

Let's denote $Exp[i][j]$ as the expected number of days to reach $G$ from weight $i$ under the condition of never surpassing $j + L$ (where $j$ is the highest weight ever reached). We define our states and transitions with this in mind:

- If $i == j$, it means our weight is at its highest $j$ for the day, thus on such days, we're guaranteed a descent unless we're at $G$. 
- If $j == G$, once we've reached $G$, no extra days are needed. 
- Otherwise, we transition through states considering both ascend and decent probabilities, and track the expected values under those scenarios.

Since direct dynamic programming is impractical due to the immense possible values of $W$ and $G$, we recognize patterns in small cases, possibly noting the recursion simplifies as:

- $Exp[W][W]=1$ if $L=0$ (because we only lose weight every day till $G$),
- Otherwise, it will depend on the highest weight structure we're maintaining.

Given the exceedingly high arithmetic values, the modulo $998{,}244{,}353$ operation is essential to fit results within bounds.

Some key events to consider:

1. If $W - G$ is even and $L > 1$ with no increase allowed past peak, the weight naturally reduces, leading to a linear expected value formula.
2. For small $L$ values, the expected dropout days can be calculated rapidly using basic recursion or previously stored values.

In summary:
- State tracking under dynamic programming principles allows for abstracting and resolving such large-arithmetic problems.
- Pattern recognition and efficient computation within loops are necessary for realizing results given the constraints and sizes of values.

# Implementation

Below is a Python solution extracting simplified expected number of days based on clean patterns recognized from small examples, handling the main logic with recursion or memoization to deal with prime constraints and large values:

Starting at a weight of \(W\) units, the goal is to reduce your weight to \(G\) units, where \(G < W\). Each day, your weight can either increase or decrease by \(1\) unit, with equal likelihood. However, you have a rule: Once your weight has ever been \(w\) units, you will not let it exceed \(w + L\) units in the future. If gaining a unit would breach this limit, you ensure a loss of one unit instead. Calculate the average number of days required to achieve the goal weight \(G\), expressed as \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \(998{,}244{,}353\)).

To solve the given problem efficiently within the large constraints:

- \( 1 \leq T \leq 90 \)
- \( 1 \leq G < W \leq 10^{18} \)
- \( 0 \leq L \leq 10^{18} \)

This formulation requires a linear time solution per test case since naive brute-force under this input size would not be feasible. 

1. Budget around \(O(T * (W - G))\) operations.
2. Given \(W - G*\) can potentially be \(10^{18}\), optimize to avoid iteration in the range.
</constraint_analysis>

<observations>

1. Each specific weight state \(w\) above \(G\) and below \(W\) can be analyzed independently, given its dependency on a previous state.
   
2. Calculate the expected days for one-unit weight losses to occur, based on the limiting condition that your weight can't exceed \(w\) units by \(L\) units.

3. Given \(W - G\) final steps to your desired weight sequence, and unique reduction rules based on lowest reached weight, apply dynamic programming or recursive decomposition where feasible:

   - Let $dp[i]$ be the expected days to reach exactly $i$ if starting strictly above $i$.

   - $dp[i]$ can be expressed as 

   \[
   dp[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(0 + dp[i+1]) + \frac{1}{2}(1 + dp[i+1])
   \]

   Because the two possibilities for the day when starting above weight $i$ are:
   
   a. Reach $i$ itself in one day directly (probability $0$),
   
   b. \(Alternatively\):
      - Gain weight to $i+1$ on this day and continue from there ($\frac{1}{2} * (1 + dp[i+1])$),
      - or you lose weight descending from $i+1$ to $i$,
         since you can safely ensure not to exceed $L$ weight gain limit.

4. For \(dp[W] (initial weight)\):
   
   Sum over significant weight transitions where the critical hurting transition limit isn't breached.
   
   \[
   dp[W] = \sum_{w=G}^{W} givenُُُُُِِِِِِِ limitُُِِِِِِِِِِِِِِِات(weight dp criterionِِِِِِِِِِِِ)
   \]

5. Implement recursive/iterative \(dp\) approach to handle large weight differences efficiently. Otherwise, calculate straightforwardly by identifying optimal bounds and utilizing mathematical relations:

\[
p = (weight transitions), q = (denominator representing cycles via multiplication factors).
\]

- Finally calculate multiplicative inverse modulo for output results completion.

# Implementation Strategy
To solve efficiently, we’ll implement dynamic programming to determine the expected days for transitioning between weights while adhering to the rules limiting excessive weight gains. The critical insight involves focusing on the calculation for the incremental nature of hitting thresholds \(G\) upwards.

1. Use dynamic programming with array \(dp\) to store expected days.
2. Compute \(dp[i]\) from \(i+1\).
3. Modulo considerations simplify overall operational cycles.
4. Output mod value adhering to format and modulo constraints.

            dp[j] = (dp[j] + (dp[max(0, j - L + 1)] if j > 0 else 0) + dp[j + 1]) * inv2 % MOD
        dp[0] = (dp[0] * W + G - W + i) % MOD

    rem = dp[0]

We can model the problem using dynamic programming, with states defined as \(expectedDays[weight]\) describing the expected number of days to reach \(G\) starting from weight \(weight\).

Let \(d(w)\) denote the expected days to reach \(G\) starting from weight \(w\).

- If \(w = G\), \(d(G) = 0\).
- If \(w \leq G - 1\), we have two options:
  1. With \(1/2\) probability, weight decreases by 1 day.
    \(d(w) = d(w-1) + 1\)
  2. With \(1/2\) probability, weight increases by 1 but must decrease back to \(w-1\) day later:
    \(d(w) = d(w-1) + 2\)
  - Hence \(d(w) = d(w-1) + 2 / 2 = d(w-1) + 1\).

If \(w > G, w < G + L\), similar rules apply but accounting for the limitations of \(L\).
- If \(w = X\), we force a direct drop back to \(X - L - 1\) weight to reach \(X - L\).
- Thus, we solve for an intermediate range \(d(w) = d(X - L) + (w - (X - L))\).

Every state needs \(L\) units of space. Total \(2L\) plus a slight buffer \(500{,}000\) should be sufficient for any constraint.

The average number of days to reach weight \(G\) from weight \(w\) can be modeled using the recursive formula:

\[ f(w) = \frac{f(w+1) + f(w-1) + c(w)}{2} \]

where \( c(w) \) is the cost incurred by moving from weight \(w\) to weight \(G\). 

If \(w > G + L\), the cost \(c(w) = 2 + L - (w - G)\). Otherwise, \(c(w) = 2\).

If \(w \leq G\), the cost is 0 because you have already reached or surpassed the target weight within the maximum allowable weight \(G + L\).

For large \(w\), this problem can be simplified into a dynamic programming approach with straightforward updates. Given the constraints, let's solve this using memoization:

1. Initialize a memo table `memo` to store precomputed \(f(w)\) values for weights up to \(G + 2L\).
2. Start from \(w = W\) and calculate each \(f(w)\) iteratively downward to \(G\).

Note: The exact recursive formula with memoization effectively handles transitions in weight adjustment costs ensuring a consistent doubling of days while adhering to the constraints.

Using modulo inverse, we handle the division operation:

\[ (p/q) \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \]

We can precompute the modulo inverse with Fermat's little theorem:

\[ q^{-1} \equiv q^{mod-2} \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \]

Finally, we print the result.

<paraphrased>
Given a current weight \(W\), an ideal weight \(G\) where \(G < W\), and a constraint \(L\), each day there's an equal probability of gaining or losing one unit of weight, except you will lose a unit if gaining would cause your weight to exceed your previous maximum plus \(L\). 

You need to determine the expected number of days until your weight reaches \(G\), expressed as a fraction \(p/q\) reduced to lowest terms and outputting \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353\). \(a^{-1}\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

The constraint ensures that the problem can be broken down into simpler subproblems, akin to a Markov process. We calculate the expected times for smaller weight differences and compose these to find the expected time for the full difference \(W - G\).

Utilizing dynamic programming or recursion to find the expected number of days, it's also crucial to handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic.

Given the upper bound of \(W \leq 10^{18}\), a naive approach with a table for expected days would be impractical as it would result in a very large memory usage and execution time. The solution must leverage mathematical insights and optimized calculations.

The \(W-G \le 10^{18}\) condition is important because it means the difference spans a large range, necessitating an efficient solution. Since each reduction of \(1\) unit in weight follows a probabilistic path, a dynamic programming approach that builds up this probability over each decrement in weight from \(W\) to \(G\) may be necessary.

**Dynamic Programming Approach**

We define \(E(x)\) as the expected number of days it will take to reach \(G\) units from \(x\) units, under the given conditions, with \(x \ge G\).

If \(x\) is less than or equal to \(G\), \(E(x) = 0\) because the goal weight is already achieved.

For a weight \(x\), if \(x\) has not hit its constraint, \(E(x)\) is given by:

\[ E(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E(x-1) + \frac{1}{2}E(x+1) \]

If \(x\) has hit its constraint \(x + L\), \(E(x)\) starts to linearly decrease as \(x\) starts monotonically decreasing towards \(G\) via deterministic behavior due to the weight limit:

\[ E(x) = 1 + E(x - 1) \]

Therefore, we can use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill up the table for \(E(x)_{G \le x \le W}\). We know \(E(G) = 0\), and go up to \(E(W)\).

Once \(E(W)\) is found, we convert it into the fraction form \(\frac{p}{q}\) and calculate \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353\).

To prevent integer overflow, use integers for multiplications and divisions, and apply modular arithmetic throughout calculations.

Using an optimized approach via matrix exponentiation or FFT can improve the speed, especially when \(W - G\) is very large.

One can model the problem recursively: at the start you're meant to lose \(W-G\) “growth days” if you can, and otherwise you're meant to lose. The trick is to reformulate the problem in terms of the state instead of the transitions, since the number of deaths will be less random than the event that causes a growth (as the weight will stop there after the first). Consequently, one can write a dynamic programming formulation where the states are the number of days of growth remaining.
</observation>
<observation>
States remove \(G\) contribution such that base case is 0.
Recursive formulation is \(F_{n} = \frac{1}{2} \times (F_{n-1} + 1) + \frac{1}{2} \times (F_{n+L} + 1)\).
Note: \(F\) represents expected number of days needed, prices the cost of adding and removing weight as equally 1.
</observation>
<observation>
This leaves us with a linear recurrence relation similar to Horner's method.
This can be processed via matrix exponentiation, since matrix powers can be exponentially faster than naive multiplication.
</observation>
<observation>
To evaluate a linear recurrence relation mod \(M\) with a matrix polynomial, we can adopt the following modulo program: 
1. Transform via a Derangement matrix to get a diagonally dominant form.
2. Apply Horner's formula in its scalar form, except evaluating each exponentiation in \(\mod\) \(M\).
3. Transform back via the same operator used in step 1.
4. Reducing mod \(M\) in the end ensures no overflowing.

We reduce the problem with a clever trick: rather than reason about weight in each state, we will reason about the number of growth days remaining. This is a clever trick that allows us to eliminate the randomness in the recursive formulation and instead talk about a fixed number of growth deaths and loss deaths rather than a secondary condition, since the latter must happen luck-only.

Specifically, denoting the expected number of days to reduce within \(n\) as \(F_{n}\):

\[ F_{n} = \begin{cases} 
  n & \text{if } n \leq 0 \\
  \frac{1}{2} (F_{n-1} + 1) + \frac{1}{2} (F_{n+L} + 1) & \text{if } n > 0 
\end{cases} \]

This can be thought of as a linear recurrence relation, but with the unfortunate feature of predictable vs non-predictable transformations. To handle this, we use the forward/backward trick from matrix exponentiation.

- Forward: Transform via a matrix to a convention
- Backward: Transform back to the original convention
- Apply Horner's method for the linear recurrence in the intermediate form

For each recursive pass, we check the base case directly, or proceed to the end case. The matrix exponentiation approach simplifies the general recurrence resolution efficiently and ensures no numerical overflow, useful in modular arithmetic.

1. Solve for \(E_i\) within \( G \leq i \leq W-L \): We know the solution for this range forms a linear equation, \(E_i = (i - G)^2\).
2. Handle the case beyond \(W - L\): 
   - Develop an analogy with the coupon collecting problem where we accumulate coupons from \(W\) to \(W - L\).
   - The coupon collecting time, from initial to target \(L\) count, is given as \( \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{L}{i} \).

   - The grand total sum expected days equals the coupon collecting sum from part 2 plus the sum of squared difference from \(G\) to \(W-L\) from part 1.

The problem can be decomposed into smaller subproblems. We can model it using dynamic programming (DP) and recursion, but due to limitations, we need modulo arithmetic and efficient handling.

Let's define \(f(i)\) as the expected days to reach \(G\) starting at \(i\). Then, we can establish the following recursion:

For \(i\) just above \(G\), the process is deterministic (since increases are not allowed):

For \(G < i \leq G + L\):

If \(G < i < G + L\), we take the average of transitioning down to \(i - 1\) (with the constraint) and up to \(i + 1\) (again with transition constraining), with expected values being 1 + f(i-1) and f(i+1) respectively, but constrained to not exceed \(i+L\).

We can memoize to avoid recalculating and cache results of intermediate states:

# Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const ll MOD = 998244353;

ll G, W, L, memo[100100];

ll modInverse(ll a, ll m) {
    ll x = 1, y = m - 2, p = 1;
    while(y > 0) {
        if (y % 2) p = p * a % m;
        x = x * x % m;
        y /= 2;
        a = a * a % m;
    }
    return p;
}

ll process(ll i) {
    if (memo[i] != -1) return memo[i];
    if (i <= G) return memo[i] = 0;
    if (G > i - L) return memo[i] = 1 + ((process(i - 1) * 2 + 1) % MOD * modInverse(3, MOD) % MOD);
    return memo[i] = (1 + (process(i - 1) * 2 + process(i + 1)) % MOD * modInverse(3, MOD) % MOD) % MOD;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        cin >> W >> G >> L;
        memo[0] = 1;
        memset(memo + 1, -1, 10010 * (sizeof(memo[0])));
        
        ll ans = ((-process(W) + 2 * (G - W - L)) % MOD * (-modInverse(L + 1, MOD))) % MOD;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

<paraphrased>
You start at weight \(W\) aiming for \(G \lt W\). Each day, your weight changes by \(+1\) or \(-1\) unit with equal probability, barring exceeding \(W + L\). Your goal is to calculate the expected number of days to achieve \(G\), expressed as \(p/q\) in lowest terms, and return \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \(998{,}244{,}353\)).

Let \(dp_w\) represent the expected number of days to get from weight \(w\) to weight \(G\). The formula for \(dp_w\) splits into three cases based on initial weight.

For \(W + L < G\): strictly one can only lose weight, so it takes \(days = W - G\) days on average.
```
dp_w = W - G
```
For \(W < G\), we maximize between losing one unit or going to \(W+L\):
```
dp_w = 1 + 0.5 * dp_(w-1) + 0.5 * dp_(w+1)
```
For \(W = G\), you've already reached \(G\):
```
dp_w = 0
```

This translates into setting up a system of equations:
If \(W\ >\ G\) and \(G-W > L\) \((\Rightarrow W+L < G)\):
```
dp_w = G - W
```
For \(W \leq G+L\) and \(W \neq G\):
```
dp_w = 1 + 0.5 * dp_(w-1) + 0.5 * dp_(w+1)
```
```
dp_w = 0; if W == G
```
Let’s solve it using **Dynamic Programming** with a recursive approach:
```
dp[0] = 0
for i in range(1, G + L - G + 1):
  dp[i] = 1 + 0.5 * (dp[i-1] + dp[i+1]), if i + 1 has a valid weight
```
Considering edge cases where G would be reached immediately or where \(W+L < G\). The recurrence relation modifies dynamically filling in optimal days required.

Post-evaluation of expected days using the dynamic programming array. Lastly, the result ratio \(p/q\) is computed and the desired value \(p \times q^{-1}\) (mod \(998{,}244{,}353\)) is returned.

        t = x0;
        x0 = x1 - q * x0;
        x1 = t;
    }
    if (x1 < 0)
      x1 += mod0;
    return x1;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int i = 1; i <= T; i++) {

        long long days = G > W + L ? 0 :
                         G == W ? 0 :
                         W - G > L ? W - G :
                         (W - G + (L - W - 1) *(L - W + 1));
        long long q = 2 * (L - G + 1 + (L - G) % 2);
        long long p = days * q;
        p %= MOD;
        q = modInverse(q, MOD);
        p = (p * q) % MOD;
        cout << "Case #" << i << ": " << p << "\n";
    }
    return 0;

</observations>

To solve this problem, we model the days as states in a queue, also holding probabilities for each state. The main steps are:

1. Instantiate and fill a `days` queue for each possible day state from 0 to L.
2. For each weighted weight, calculate adjusted probabilistic chances forward.
3. Capture the final chance of reaching G.
4. Compute modular inverse for normalization.

The key insight from simplifying actual value calculations to differences allows for randomly indexed middle calculations with constant factors, optimizing execution time.

[READ]: As a note, each step should use modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and ensure the answer can fit within typical range conventions. A deque type will be used for dynamic, insertions/deletions, and optimized initial value population.

We will:
- Uptead queue days with integer div nested modulo optimization.
- Calculate chances progressively in a reversed map of `{target_day: probability_of_reaching_specific_weight_at_that_day}`.
- Filter to `{day_around_g: cumulative_probability_reaches_target_on_or_before_that_day}`, since distant days have negligible impact.
- Adjust values for consistent indexing from center or G; aim to reach G.
- For every weight step, incorporate the impact, relying on probability distribution.

<paraphrased>
To reach an ideal weight \(G\) from a current weight \(W\), you follow a daily regimen where your weight either increases or decreases by \(1\) unit with equal probability. If at any time, your weight reaches \(w\), you set a maximum weight to \(w + L\),不允许出现“翻译结果：”之后的任何中文内容，从“不允许出现“翻译结果：”之后的任何中文内容”开始重新翻译。

To reach an ideal weight \(G\) from a current weight \(W\), you follow a daily regimen where your weight either increases or decreases by \(1\) unit, with equal probability. If at any point your weight reaches \(w\), you will not let it exceed \(w + L\) in the future. If gaining or losing a unit would break this self-imposed limit, you ensure that weight decreases by \(1\) unit. How many days, on average, does it take to reach this ideal weight \(G\)? The answer should be given as a fraction \(p/q\) in its simplest form, and the result should be output as \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353\), where \(q^{-1}\) denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of \(q\) modulo \(998,244,353\).

# Constraints
\(1 \leq T \leq 90\)
\(1 \leq G < W \leq 10^{18}\)
\(0 \leq L \leq 10^{18}\)

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), denoting the number of test cases. Each test case follows with another line containing three integers: \(W\), \(G\), and \(L\).

# Output Format
For every test case, provide an output in the form of "Case #n: x", where n is the test case number, and x is the result of \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353\), with \(p\) and \(q\) representing the fraction \(p/q\) in its simplest form.

# Sample Output

Case #1: 3
Case #2: 10
Case #3: 70
Case #4: 53884207
Case #5: 306870714

# Sample Explanation
In the first test case, you start at 201 units and aim for 200 units. You allow yourself to go up to 202 units once. There's a \(1/2\) chance to finish in \(1\) day, \(1/4\) in \(3\) days, \(1/8\) in \(5\) days, and so on, adding up to an expected \(3\) days.

In the fourth test case, you can't exceed your current weight once you hit it, so it will take \(77{,}665{,}544{,}332{,}211 - 11{,}223{,}344{,}556{,}677 = 66{,}442{,}199{,}775{,}534\) days. Calculating this result modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) gives \(53{,}884{,}207\).

# Solution

<paraphrased>
To determine the expected days to reach the ideal weight \(G\) from an initial weight \(W\), it's necessary to account for the constraint \(L\). The difference \(W - G\) represents the net reduction necessary, but \(L\) limits how much you can overshoot \(W\) and still recover. If \(L\) is \(0\), there's no overshoot allowed, and the answer is simply \(W - G\). Otherwise, the expected days can be found by analyzing the probabilistic outcomes and adjusting for \(L\).

Through a dynamic programming or recursive approach with memoization, one can calculate the expected days. Specifically, the strategy would use recursion where each step represents a day and considers two possibilities: weight increasing by \(1\) and weight decreasing by \(1\), narrowing in on \(G\) while honoring \(L\). The recursion would eventually converge to the expected days.

Given \(S = W - G\) is the initial distance to target weight and \(L\) is the allowed weight cap excess after first hitting some weight \(w\), the expected number of days \(E\) to reach \(G\) can be determined. For simplicity, we can use dynamic programming or formulae for bounded random walks.

Let \(E(S)\) be the expected number of days to reach the target weight. Given \(L\):
- If \(W - G \leq L\), the number of expected steps needed to go from \(W\) to \(G\) is \(2(W-G)\), as it’s simplified to a direct decrement problem with no restriction constraint.

- When \(L < W - G\), calculating \(E(S)\) for \(S > L\) becomes more intricate:
  - The base case is \(E(0) = 0\) and \(E(S) = S + 1 + 0.5 * E(S-1) + 0.5 * E(S+1)\) because there’s an equal chance of weight going up or down, and weight reduction won’t violate constraints up to \(L\).
  - Constraints on reaching \(S+L\) add the condition \(E(S+L) = E(L)\). Solving the recurrence relation gives us the expected day count for each of the \(S\) steps.

- Solving for \(E(S)\) allows us to calculate step counts. Using dynamic programming for these calculations will ensure optimal speeds and handling limit operations properly. We can then output our results modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

For large constraints \(S > L\), the recursion may be large but will be optimally solved with memoization.

            days = difference * 2;
        } else {
            difference -= L;
            days = (difference * (difference + 1)) % MOD; // sum of differences reduced
            days = (days * modInv(2)) % MOD; // inverse of 2
            days = (days + (power(2, difference) - 1 + MOD) % MOD * modInv(power(2, difference) - 1 + MOD) % MOD) % MOD; // account for bottleneck effect

Imagine a process where your weight fluctuates due to random changes, but it can never exceed its highest record by $L$ units.

The objective is to find the expected number of days (or steps) it takes to reach $G$ from $W$.

Expected values in sequences like this can often be derived analytically by defining a system of equations. Assume that weight $w$ takes $E[w]$ days to reach $G$ on average. Clearly, if you reach $G$, the number of days is $E[w] = 0$ since you don’t have to lose weight anymore.

$E[w]$, if in the free interval \(G < w \leq W\), isn’t affected by boundary conditions and both gains and losses are active, derived by a relation formed averaging, based on weighted expectation:
\[
E[w] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E[w - 1] + \frac{1}{2}E[w + 1]
\]
Rearranging:
\[
E[w + 1] = 2(E[w] - 1) - E[w - 1]
\]

However, once you are in the region \(W < w \leq W + L\), gaining weight is always avoided, hence we derive:
\[
E[w] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E[w - 1]
\]

Since this is a forward recurrence, compute $E[w]$ iteratively. Starting from \(W + L\), set \(E[w] = 0\) for \(w > G\), \(E[w] = w-G\).

However, it’s crucial here to derive a closed-form solution via solving these recurrences and rechecking it through back substitution, taking advantage of the logarithmic gap \(W - L \to G\).

You embark on a journey to lose weight from \(W\) to \(G\). Each day, with equal chance, you may lose or gain a pound. If at some point, your weight was \(w\) and you tried to exceed \(w+L\), you enforce a loss to not surpass this limit. The objective is to determine the expected duration in days to reach \(G\), expressed as a fraction \(p/q \mod 998244353\).

The constraints \(1 \leq W \leq 10^{18}\), \(0 \leq L \leq 10^{18}\), and \(1 \leq G \lt W \leq 10^{18}\) allow values to be very large, so typical operations like summing or comparing would overflow integers. We need calculations to proceed in a different way, notably modulo arithmetic.

To solve the provided problem, we can perform a backwards dynamic programming algorithm. The key idea is that the target weight $G$ will always lead to 0 days. Thus, using a backward fill, we start from $G$ and progress toward $W$, capturing steps and expected days. This approach forbids direct leaps or recursions over large values and allows practical calculation limits.

- The dynamic programming array \(dp[i]\) tracks the expected number of days from \(i\) to \(G\).
- Use the relation derived from equal chance of increasing or decreasing weight: \(dp[i] = 2 \times dp[i+1] - dp[i+2] - 1\) for all $i \neq G, W, W+1$. 
- Consider boundary cases carefully especially when limiting weight constraint \(L\) impacts availability to push weight back.
- Use modular arithmetic to manage very large values, implementing fast exponentiation for powers and modular inverses where necessary, as specified in problem constraints.

We have an initial weight \(W\) and a goal weight \(G < W\). Each day, the weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal probability. We have a strict rule: the weight will never exceed \(W + L\). We aim to find the expected number of days required to reach \(G\) units, expressed as an integer \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,243,353\).

# Constraints

- If \(W > G + L\), we simulate reaching \(G\) without violation, with a recursive model:
  - If \(W < G\): it needs 2 steps (one up and one down).

The solution uses modular arithmetic and exponentiation by squaring to compute the modular inverse for the expected value. The steady-state transitions yield a geometric series, which can be easily solved using the modular inverse.

<paraphrased>
Given your current weight \(W\), your target weight \(G < W\), and a limit \(L\), you aim to reach \(G\) units by either gaining or losing a unit each day, without ever exceeding your weight plus \(L\) after any weight has been hit. This problem requires calculating the average number of days to reach \(G\) units, with the answer provided modulo \(998,244,353\).

For \(L = 0\): If \(W - G\) is even, success is possible with an average of \((W - G)^2/4\) days, otherwise, it's impossible.

For \(\min(W - G, L) \leq 0\): It's impossible since \(W\) is already lower than \(G\) or not far enough from violating the limit.

Else \(W - G \leq L\): This amounts to a random walk with a bias, where even attempting to reach \(G\) would break your rule.

Else \(W - G > L\): Employ dynamic programming (DP) with probabilities.

For example, let \(D[X]\) denote average days required for weight \(W-X\).

\(D[0] = 0\).

\(D[\min(W - G, L)] = (2 \times \min(W - G, L) + 1)\).

\(D[x] = \frac{D[x-1] + D[x+1] + 2}{2}\) for all \([1, \min(W - G, L)-1]\).

### Explanation

1. We use an ordered set to keep track of possible states, each represented by a weight and the number of steps taken to reach it.
2. The algorithm initializes the set to include the starting weight and the first modification, and iteratively updates these states according to the logic of the problem:
   - If we can prevent an excessive increase (i.e., if the current weight minus 2 is \(\leq W\)), we insert a state representing a move down.
   - Likewise, we insert a state representing a move up.
3. The outer loop continues until the minimum viable state in the set matches \(g + l + 1\).
4. The special cases are handled at the beginning and the end of the algorithm to simplify the general logic and eliminate superfluous conditions during execution.
5. After determining \((p, q)\), the inverse of \(q\) (modulo \(998244353\)) is calculated and used to determine the final result, outputting the product \(p \times q^{-1}\) modulo \(998244353\).

You begin at weight \(W\), and your goal is to reach an ideal weight \(G\) where \(G < W\). Each day, your weight will either increase or decrease by 1 unit with equal probability. However, you have a strict rule: once your weight has reached \(w\) units, you will never allow it to exceed \(w + L\). If gaining 1 unit would violate this rule, you will ensure that you lose 1 unit instead. Your task is to calculate, on average, the number of days it will take to reach a weight of \(G\) units. The result should be expressed as \(p \times q^{-1}\) mod \(998,244,353\), where \(p/q\) is the answer in its simplest form.

Let \(dp[i]\) be the expected number of days to reach \(G\) starting from weight \(i\).

The base case is \(dp[G] = 0\) – if we're already at the goal weight \(G\), we need no more days.

For all other states, \(i\), the recurrence relation is:

dp[i - 1] &\text{if } i >  w + L \land G < w + L \text{ for some } w < W\\
0.5 \cdot dp[i + 1] + 0.5 \cdot dp[i - 1] + 1 &\text{if } G \leq w + L \text{ for some } w < W \text{ or } G = i\text{ and }i < w + L\\

This formulation leverages the fact that the weights can bounce back but the movement is restricted to not exceed the \(w + L\) rule. The average cases above cover whether the goal \(G\) is within the allowed weight range or if one can be near but not exceed a barrier.

Using modular multiplicative inverses to handle sums and averages under modulo \(998,244,353\):

\[ 2^{-1} \text{(mod 998244353)} = 499122177 \]

Your weight starts at \(W\), with a goal to reach \(G\) (where \(G < W\)). Each day, your weight changes by \(+1\) or \(-1\) unit with equal probability. If your weight ever exceeds \(w\), you will never exceed \(w+L\) in the future. Calculate the expected number of days to reach \(G\), considering the constraint, and output \(p \times q^{-1}\) modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

If weight \(W \leq G\) or \(W + L < G\), we have a definitive impossibility to follow the constraint and achieve the target weight. Therefore, it’s not possible to adjust weight to exactly \(G\) units.

For \(L = 0\), the expected number of days to go from weight \(W\) to \(G\) is \((W - G)^2\). 

If \(L > 0\), we use dynamic programming to manage state transitions in terms of weight and within the borders of our constraint. We need to consider probabilities from each state transfer.

We'll use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Considering the possible states and transitions, the problem could be tackled by:

1. Identifying each state defined by the current weight and the maximum extendable weight as `M`.
2. Two states can be connected if the differences in their weights and `M` can be transformed by \(\pm 1\) step.
3. Tracking the expected days until reaching \(G\) using a recursive function with memory optimization to avoid re-computation.

Here is a high-level plan:
- Identify the maximum weight of interest as \( \min(W + L, G + L) \)
- Use BFS to initialize states for weights between \( \min(W, G) \) and \( \min(W + L, G + L)) \), setting \(M\) to start at \(W\).
- Step through each day, updating states and expected days for it.
- Edge cases for \(G = W-1\) and \(M \leq G\) require careful handling.
- Collectively, this leads to two DP functions, \(dp(n, m)\) and \(e(n, m)\), processing states in BFS and updating expectations recursively with memoization.

Details of the algorithm:
- Recursively calculate the number of days to reach \(G\) using states and updates normalized by 2 (either weight increases or decreases).
- For each weight case, handle transitions as maximized by the rule, ensuring transition criteria and avoiding overstepping bounds.
- Use modular arithmetic for result output and inverse computation.

Starting at a weight \(W\) (with \(W > G\)), your goal is to reach a weight \(G\). Each day, your weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit, each with a 50% probability. You set a strict rule: your weight will never exceed \(L\) units above your maximum recorded weight. Determine, on average, how many days it will take you to reach a weight of \(G\). Your answer should be a ratio of integers in lowest terms, with the result modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Let \(E_{w,\ell}\) denote the expected number of days to reach \(G\) starting from weight \(w\) and peak weight \(\ell\). The dynamic programming formulation:
- \(E_{G, \ell} = 0\), since you're already at the goal.
- \(E_{w, \ell} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(E_{w-1, \ell} + E_{\min(w+1,\ell+L), \min(\ell+L, \ell+L)})\).
- Simplifies to \(E_{w, \ell} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(E_{w-1, \ell} + E_{\min(w+1, \ell+L), \ell+L})\).

That is:
- Reduce the problem to a smaller weight.
- Adjust for the constraint preventing exceeding peak weight plus \(L\).

Handling large weights and peaks is done efficiently with a combination of simple memoization and matrix exponentiation for the transition matrix. Both weights and peaks can overflow, making careful handling necessary.

### Approach to solving the Problem

Directly simulating every possible weight scenario is unfeasible because of the potentially large values of $W$ and $G$. Using a more mathematical approach rather than a simulation-based one could help.

The core of this problem involves calculating expected values, which often appear in dynamic programming or recursion problems. A transition probability between weights can be established. Since the weight change each day is stochastic and has to be constrained by the forbidding rule, a recursion of expectations on weights can be conceptualized.

For example, considering a single bound $L$ and desired weight $G$, sub-problems where specific ranges of weight (from $G + 1$ to $G + L$) must be analyzed to form a recurrence of expectations.

In constructing the solution:
1. Utilize the recursion or dynamic programming approach to model the expected weight days to drop from any intermediate weight between $G + 1$ and $G + L$.
2. Keep in mind, for simplicity, the regions higher than $G + L$ where no transitions up are possible are straightforward.
3. The main focus is $L$ values $G + k$ (for all $k: 1 \leq k \leq L$) since these are subject to change, based on the given transition probabilities noted.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let $E[x]$ represent the expected time to reach $G$ starting from a weight of $x$, with transitions according to the problem statement. The key insight is that beyond $G+L$, the transitions reverse the increase logic: once weight goes higher, always force a decrease.

The brute-force recursive solution to calculate $E[x]$ will then involve summing transitions times their probabilities. Leveraging properties of linearity of expectations and efficient computation like matrix exponentiation or recursive formulas can let us calculate these expectations efficiently in O(L) time for each query.

Due to the potentially large values of $L$ and the need to find modular inverses and perform large exponentiations, utilizing efficient algorithms for modular arithmetic, like modular exponentiation, is essential.

You currently weigh \( W \) units and your target weight is \( G < W \) units. Each day, your weight either increases or decreases by \( 1 \) unit, each with equal probability. You also have a strict rule that you will never exceed your maximum allowable weight, which is \( w + L \) if you have ever weighed \( w \) units. Your goal is to determine the average number of days it will take you to reach your target weight \( G \), expressed as \( p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353 \) where \( p/q \) is in simplest form.

To solve:
1. Define an auxiliary probability \( P[i] \) as the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from weight \( i \).
2. Use a backward approach to calculate \( P[i] \) from \( P[G] \).
3. For each weight \( i \), determine the next weight to reach \( G \).
4. Adjust \( P[i] \) according to the reachable weights and constraints.
5. Use modular arithmetic to compute \( P[W] \mod 998,244,353 \).

Each weight transition is:
\[ P[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left( P[i+1] + P[\min(i+1, i+L)] \right), \]
if \( i+L < G \) and the weight is within bounds.

The problem frames a scenario where daily weight fluctuations (-1 or +1) must not exceed a strict upper limit \(w + L\), where \(w\) is the lowest weight ever reached. Initially weighing \(W\) units and aiming for \(G\) units (with \(W > G\)), on average, calculate the expected number of days to achieve the target weight. Assuming \(p/q\) as the solution, output \(p \times (q^{-1}) \mod 998244353\).
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
The weight difference \(W - G\) and limit \(L\) both may be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), so a brute-force solution or dynamic programming within those ranges is infeasible.

<observations>
<observation>The minus-one weight changes would keep an average horizon of reaching G when no weight limit. This is \(W-G\).</observation>
<observation>The limit of never again going higher than the lowest weight limits can be regarded as lowering the sanest optimal weight. This is \(G+L\).</observation>
<observation>A crucial insight is considering a local group of weights instead of an individual unit. We transition from group to group, as the group size doubles every two days.</observation>
<observation>Initialization: Let \(W = (G+L)\), and a group size \(S = 1\).</observation>
<observation>We keep repeating the process: Check if we can jump into an upcoming group, represented as \(jump = \left\lfloor \frac{w - G}{S} \right\rfloor\). If we can jump, we add the days needed to the total, and adjust the current weight, then double the group size.</observation>
<observation>It helps to maintain a buffer of skipped days, representing days where our weight exceeds the next group but still decreases to a manageable range.</observation>
<observation>Continue until \(jump = 0\). Depending on \(S\), we calculate the remaining non-cancellable days by averaging over remaining weight separation and a ratio of 2 days per group necessitated by doubling.</observation>

To approach an optimal solution, let's use a modified binary search on the days. We'll consider "skipping" days where the weight drifts above a group of weights but corrects itself back to a valid position within a group as an adjustment. 

We start with the lowest weight ever \(W\) being \(G+L\) and a group size \(S\) of \(1\). As the group size doubles every two days, we may consider each "jump" valid as long as the next doubled group size implies a calculable number of days traverse. We'll denote \(jump\). If \(jump\) is non-zero, then we can make this jump, adding required days to the total. Afterwards, we adjust the weight subtracted by the remainder of the jump and the group size. We repeat until there's no more jump we can make.

Once the gap between the current weight and \(G\) cannot be jumped over directly by the doubling mechanism, we handle the remainder in a final step considering the average number of days needed in case of a faulty alignment, where days that would regularly correct the weight beyond the group still contribute to lowering the weight.

We then calculate the final answer parameterized by \(p \times (q^{-1}) \mod 998244353\).

We start by observing the simplest scenario, where \( W \) never exceeds \( W + L \) (since \( G < W \)). In this case, the expected number of days is \( W - G \) because each day your weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit and since \( W > G \), you'll see \( W \rightarrow G \) progression.

If \( W \) could possibly exceed \( W + L \), then let \( W_0 \) denote \( \max(W, G + L) \). \( I_0 \), the number of trapped days between \( G \) and \( W_0 \) day counts as follows:
\[
I_0 = \frac{(W_0 - G)(W_0 - G - 1)}{2}
\]
Given \( Q_0 \), the expected time as of \( W_0 \) to reach \( G \), solving for \( Q_0 \):
\[
I_0 + \frac{Q_0 + 1}{2} = Q_0 \Rightarrow Q_0 = I_0 + 1
\]

For \( W_i \), \( W_{i+1} = \max(W_i - G + L, G + L) \):

**Iteration process:**
- Calculate \( I'_{i+1} \):
\[
I'_{i+1} = \frac{(W_i - G)(W_i - G - 2)}{2} + (I_i + W_i - G)
\]
where:
- \( I_i \) is the total trapped days as of \( i \)

Using \( I_i \) with each iteration:
\[
I_i + \left( Q_i + 1 \right) = (I_i + I'_{i+1} + W_i - G) + \frac{Q_i + 1}{2}
\]

We iterate this updating the values of \( W_i \) until \( W_i \leq G \).

We utilize modular inverse \( q^{-1} \) such that:
\[
p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353
\]
For large numbers, we use the Extended Euclidean algorithm

The first observation is to use dynamic programming to model our problem using an array `dp`.

`dp[i]` will be the expected days to reach `G` from weight `i`. When `i` is `W+L`, you cannot gain weight, so every step after that will add 2 days since every day is a guaranteed loss.

Considering the recurrence:

- `dp[i] = 1 + 0.5 * dp[i-1] + 0.5 * dp[i+1]` for `i` between `G+1` and `W+L-1`.
- If `i = G`, obviously `dp[i] = 0`.
- If `i > W + L`, we are forced to lose weight (hence `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2`).

By induction, we see a linear system of equations forming, which can be written out explicitly
for the states and solved using a linear algebra solver, which we can solve efficiently with modular arithmetic.
A different way to look at the recurrence relations involves imagining the situation as an arithmetic progression: the initial difference of 2 steps jumps to 4, 6, etc. (due to how we force weight down).

The code will assemble these equations and solve them. Since operations are done modulo \(998,244,353\) to stay within manageable numbers, remember to also find modular inverses.

Based on the restrictions and observations:
- If \(L = 0\), the problem is straightforward as you can only lose weight and it's a simple calculation.
- If \(W - G > L\), you can solve using probability principles and expected value calculations through dynamic programming, keeping track of the state and moving forward iteratively.
- When \(L \geq W - G\), the problem reduces to a variation with constraints on the weights. This can be modelled using dynamic programming of a simplified state space due to the finite feasible states.

This problem has to do with the expectation of the number of steps to reach the target \(G\) under constraints. Starting from current weight \(W > G\), we'll maintain only two states, being either above \(G\) or truly aiming towards \(G\) but still respecting the peak \(w+L\) constraints.

Exploiting the simple step nature simplifies the dynamic programming transition into a recursion over \(W-G\) steps, giving:

1. \( \mathbb{E}(W > G) =  2 + \mathbb{E}(W-1)\)
2. \( \mathbb{E}(W  = G) =  0\)

which for unrestricted segments reduce to \(2(W-G)\).

For steps involving peaks, an adjustment step is a somewhat \(1\) day cost, leading extended strategies:
- If \(W = w = w + L\), recursion extremal scenario down to individual weights directly affecting the expectation a lot.
- If \(W < w+L\), employs compounded interest type of recursion and case refinement.

To solve, precompute for constraints \(L\) via dynamic programming up to the initial weight to \(G\) range, factor in the lingering complexities from constraints. Lastly, compute using modular arithmetic, yielding \(p\times (q)^{-1} \mod 998,244,353\).

The expected days to hit weight \(G\) can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. The key observation we utilize here is that all weight transitions up to weight \(W + L\) are symmetrically distributed around \(G\). Given that you can't increase past \(W + L\), you can model your solution recursively.

\(t[i]\) denotes the expected time to reach \(G\) starting from weight \(i\). Then, for \(i < G\):
\[t[i] = \frac{1 + t[i + 1] + t[i - 1]} {2}\]
Since the weight gain probability is 1/2, and similarly loss probability is 1/2.

Let's normalize \(W\) and \(G\) such that all values in use are at least \(0\). So we'll reframe the above as:
\[t[i] = 1 + \frac{t[i + 1] + t[i - 1]} {2}\]

With base case
\[t[G] = 0\]

Now let’s introduce an inverse relationship. For \(L = 0\), we virtually step by 2 units at a time:
\[t[i] = \frac{t[i + 2]} {2} - 1\]

However, when \(L \gt 0\), this equation translates into a linear formula:
\[t[i] = \frac{G - i} {L + 1} (2L + 3) - 1 - L\].

Thus, the recursive relation becomes straightforward and allows such traversal from \(W\) to \(G\).

Finally, the modulo operation should be taken under the condition provided.

Every day, your weight changes by \( \pm 1 \) with equal probability. However, you enforce a constraint that your future weight will never be greater than \( w + L \) once it reaches \( w \). Given a starting weight \( W \), a target weight \( G \) and the constraint factor \( L \), the challenge is to calculate the expected number of days to reach \( G \) as \(\frac{p}{q} \). The result must be given as \( p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \).

You are restricted to \( 1 \leq G < W  \leq 10^{18} \) and must output results in the specified format, wherein \( q^{-1} \) is the modular inverse of \( q \) under modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
Due to the high upper bound for \( W \) and \( L \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)), direct brute-force methods are impractical. Dynamic programming or mathematical insight needs to be applied. The constraint on \( T \) (up to 90) is manageable.

Considering the constraint $L$, imagine the weight as being on a board game path. The expected number of moves from any weight to $G$ within $L$ steps beyond $G$ scales quadratically with the distance. Mathematically, for each intermediary state \( i \) starting from \( G \) up to \( G + L \), we can form a difference equation to define the expected days \( E[i] = (E[i-1] + E[i+1] + 2) / 2 \). Given \( E[G] = 0 \) and \( E[G+1] = (G+1) \), we solve the difference equation for intermediary \( E \).

For the weight higher than \( G+L \), $$E[i] = (i-G-1)^2 + E[G+L]$$ 

The overall solution comprises two parts: a linear interval of length \( L + 1 \) starting at \( G \) with a known expected number of days \( E[G+1] \), and a transition to a quadratic injury.

For simplification, let's denote this problem in two segments: \( E[1] \) for \( G+1 \to W \) and \( E[2] \) to translate \( W+1 \to W+L+1 \).

Applying this, we solve in two key steps:
1. Determine overall expected time from \( G \), ignoring constraint, as \( E[i] = (i - G + 1)^2 \).
2. Adjust \( E[i] \) using modular inverse (to eliminate fraction) for all \( E[i] \) values interpreted modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

Consider $G+L$ to be our maximum limit for lowest weight. The steps taken can be visualized line segments. Some are invalid, and some go above that limit. If $L \gg W-G$ then the answer is only expected number of steps to navigate from $G$ to $W-G$ parity and up to $L$ as the lowest weight:

\[ \text{Answer} = (W-G) \times 5 +  (W-L - (W-G)) \times ((W-G) \times 2) \]
 
\[ N = (W - G) \times 5 + \text{continuation of random walk}.\]

The continuation is only $2$ times of regular expected steps.

We need to handle the chance that $G \le w < W \le w + L$, where we can ignore invalid $< G$ (lower steps) and $ > W$ (higher steps). To ensure we don't overestimate the steps, we only count expected steps for the relevant portion.

To solve this, first observe the recurrence relation when trying to calculate the expected time by starting from a high number $n$:
- If $n \geq G$ and $n \leq K = W + 1 - L$, it follows that $X_{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(X_{n - 1} + X_{n + 1})$.
- If $n > K$ then $X_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(X_{n - 1} + X_{n + 1 - L})$.

This can be rephrased in terms of a discrete differential equation. In the first region, the slope is constant between consecutive values of $n$. In the second, it is between $n$ and $n + 1 - L$. The slope in the first region can be solved directly, but the slope from $K$ to $W$ is harder.

One real-valued solution to the region $K$ to $W$ is $f(n) = -n$. This gives you $y_{n + 1 - L} + y_n$ a constant $C$, and using $X_W = 0$ it can be determined $C = L$.
Now, since the difference between solutions is also a solution:
- From $n = K - 1$ to $W$ we get $X_n = (L - n)(L + 1 - n)$.
- Joining the piecewise solutions with a $X_K$ parameter we get an equation $g(n) = (L - n)(L + 1 - n) + C$.
- Simplifying this gives an explicit form $X_n = (L - n)(L + 1 - n) - (L + 1 - K)K$.

If $L \geq d$, the formula directly gives $X_W = 0$ and we can get $X_G$ via the above formula. If it's less, a solution complying with $X_W = 0$ can be of the form $X_n = \frac{1}{L + 1 - n}$, and plugging in gives $X_G = \frac{L + 1 - G}{L + 1 - W}$.

Combining these two solutions gives a single formula.

To compute a division with $\mathbf{mod}$, we use an extended gcd algorithm to calculate modular inverses.

Finally, also try and avoid massive intermediate values by using $mod$ where possible.

Let the function \(f(w)\) be the expected number of days to hit \(G\) starting from \(w\), without the weight limit constraint. Then, the defining recurrence is

\[f(w) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}( f(w-1) + f(w+1) ),\]

\[f(G) = 0,\]

which can be solved as

\[f(w) = (w - G)^2.\]

We want a function \(g(w)\) that, on top of respecting the target weight constraint, is the lowest number of days needed to reach that target weight considering any intermediary constraint \(w\):

\[g(w) = \begin{cases}
f(w) & \text{if } w \le G, \\
L + g(w - L - 1) & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\]

In both cases (`f(w)` and `g(w)`),

\[g(w) \le w - G + L.\]

We can precompute \(g(w)\) using dynamic programming, then use the fractions we get to do some amortized binary search for each weight decrement. Each call to the auxiliary operation `find_days`, which looks like (optimization for large `G`) a weighted binary search, takes time sublinear in \(G\).

Starting at weight W units, one aims to reach a target weight G units, where G is less than W. Each day, weight changes by 1 unit, with equal probability to go up or down. The weight regimen includes a constraint that the weight can never rise above the minimum weight plus an allowable range L. Given these conditions, we need to find the expected number of days required to reach the target weight G units. The final output should be the result after computing the quotient of the solution's fraction representation, modulo 998244353.
</paraphrased>

### Constraints:
- The interval length (W - G) is important; it dictates the direct path in weight reduction modulo the constraints.
- If W is too far from G, the constraint around the max allowable increase L will come into play.
- Maximum W, G, and L values are $10^{18}$, thus direct computation of probabilities is impractical.

### Core Assumptions and Simplifications:
1. If the weight ever reaches the constraint limit Weight at least G-L and less than W, the remaining days are calculable directly because the probability to go further up is nil.
2. If Weight - G > L, the problem simplifies to deterministic weight-reduction process since the constraint L is useless, and only weight reduction is essential.

### analysis:
To conceptualize the expected number of days to reach the goal, a simplified model is created:
1. If Weight - G <= L, it implies the maximum constraint L hasn't come into effect at all times, making each day's weight change random until the minimum weight met.
2. If Weight - G > L, each day sees a deterministic 1 unit weight loss aimed precisely at G.

#### Approach:
1. **Case 1**: If W + L <= G, we work within deterministic weight loss of 1 unit per day towards G.
2. **Case 2**: If W - L > G, utilize the understanding that future movement is probabilistic until the weight constraint kick-in.
3. **Case 3**: For intermediate regimes, mixed states may occur and require modeling probability driven by constraint reach.

With intuition around mixed-state probabilities and direct computation out of question due to large limits, it becomes essential to handle each case separately.
#### Implementation with pseudo-infinite series insight:
For each case, compute the expected number of days with a constraint passed along from cumulative insights, summing up to 2 * N - 1 if probabilistic, or minimizing below based on inference till realistic gap.
In case of heavy cycles or control prior latest seen, compute util modulatory recursion, the expected evening out to expected number of days as per each state.

You start at weight \(W\) and aim to reach weight \(G < W\). Every day your weight changes with probability \(1/2\) to either +1 or -1, unless it would exceed your maximum weight \(w + L\). To avoid this, you ensure a weight loss when it becomes necessary. Calculate the average number of days required to reach \(G\) days and return it modulo 998,244,353 as \(p \times q^{-1}\).

<observation>In general, the expected number of days is $2 * (W - G)$. If the upper limit forces increases beyond \(W\), the result is that we effectively lose the availability of certain increases, so it will take longer.</observation>
<observation>We can prove this statement via a change of variable or by Markov chains, but if the result seems mysterious, perhaps the reader can try small examples. Consider \(W = 5\), \(G = 1\), \(L = 2\). Then you will reach \(1\) eventually, irrespective of the order of moves.</observation>
<observation>If you are ever at \(w \leq G\) and you've only seen \(g < G\), you can continue following your exact same regimen and reach weight \(g\) at the same expected number of days as if you were starting from weight \(w\), no matter what happened in the past. It converges to \(2 * (G-g)\).</observation>
<observation>This means we can simplify the problem from considering the whole infinite set of possibilities (each with a probability involving the Catalan numbers) to just two possibilities:</observation>
<observation>1. There is a jump from \(x\) to \(Y\). We update \(W\) to be \(Y\) and continue looking for the next jump (reduce the upper limit by \(1\)). This costs \(E(W, G, L-1) +1\) days on average.</observation>
<observation>2. There is at least one time when the weight equals \(W\). This requires an expected \(1\) day. If no such time existed, then you must have had been at \(y \leq W\) already solved with an expected number of days of \(2 * (W - y)\), a contradiction.</observation>
<observation>If we suspect this is the end, we solve each problem iteratively using this baseline expectation.</observation>
<observation>To conclude, our calculation proceeds from large weight to smaller weight (since lower weights are harder to reach).</observation>

To solve the problem, we need to use the insight that the expected number of days to reach the target is primarily dictated by the difference between the initial and desired weight. However, if the proposed maximum weight \( W + L \) prevents increases, the dynamics become more complex.

1. If \(G\) is within the acceptable range, the number of days expected is a straightforward \(E = 2 * (W - G) \).
2. If \(G\) isn't directly reachable but the weight can increment further, additional complexity arises due to "windows" where weight increase reduces options.

We can formulate a recursive solution starting from the highest weights down to \(G\) and adjust for the strict rule:

You are currently at weight \(W\) and aim to reach weight \(G\) by either gaining or losing a unit of weight each day, with equal probability. However, your weight cannot exceed your maximum previous weight plus \(L\) units. You need to calculate the expected number of days until you reach \(G\), expressed as \(p \times q^{-1}\) modulo \(998,244,353\).

# Constraints Analysis
The number of test cases \(T\) can go up to \(90\), with \(W\) and \(G\) being at most \(10^{18}\) and \(L\) at most \(10^{18}\).

Given the range, we should strive to design an efficient solution that processes each test case in sublinear time.

# Observations
<observation>
- Assume \(W\) is your current weight and \(G\) is the target weight. The number of units we need to lose is \(D := W - G\).
- On a given day, you lose a unit if you read your historical max weight; otherwise, your expected daily change in weight is \(\pm 1\) with equal probability.
- For \(G + L < W\), even with no constraints, expected days to lose \(D\) units is \(D^2\) by standard will-cross-0 expectation problems.
- Consider the "current" weight to be a proxy for \(W\); if we ever get to reach \(W\) units, we stop.
- The hard constraints are on the transition from \(G + L\) to \(G\), termed the constrained region.
- Once you get past the constrained region you have a stateless problem.
- Thus the additional \(D \times (D - L)\) steps to get out of the constrained region.
- Thus the total number of expected steps is \(D^2 + D \times (D - L)\).

We consider a function \(f(x)\) representing the expected number of days to reach \(G\) from weight \(x\). The key observations are:

1. If \(x\) is less than or equal to \(G\), the expected number of days is \(0\).
2. If \(x\) exceeds \(G\), the expected number of days is defined in terms of the average of the expected number for \(x+1\) and \(x-1\) (plus an additional day for the current step itself). 
3. There’s a special constraint too: if \(x\) exceeds the maximum possible (initial weight plus \(L\)), then \(x\) is treated as though it's \(W\).

We can formulate the overall function as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } x \leq G \\
\frac{1 + f(x-1) + f(x+1)}{2} & \text{otherwise}
\]

We introduce an intermediate step \(\text{square}(f)\), which maps a function \(f\) (where \(f(i)\) maps to \(x\)) to a new function \(g(y)\), which maps to the expected number of days. This \(\text{square}(f)\) can be simplified iteratively until convergence.

To precompute values, we apply the \(\text{square}(f)\) operation iteratively. Iterate this operation, starting from \(f(x) = \max(0, W - x)\) for \(x\) within the critical range, about \(8-9\) times for precision.

Finally, output \(f(0)\), the expected number of days from weight \(W\) to \(G\). By periodicity, \(f(0)\) equals \(f(W - G)\).

For modulo calculations:
\[ 
p/q \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \rightarrow (\underbrace{(p \times q^{-1})}_{\text{modular inverse}} \mod 998{,}244{,}353)

Here, \(q^{-1}\) denotes the modular inverse of \(q\) modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

We're given a process where the weight changes by \( \pm 1 \) with equal probability each day until we reach \( G \). The critical thing to note is that if we've been at weight \( w \), we won't let our weight exceed \( w + L \) in the future. For simplicity, let's assume \( W > G + L \) to avoid trivial cases.

Let's define \( E(x) \) as the expected number of days for us to reach \( G \) starting at weight \( x \).

Here are the fundamental properties and simplifications:
- \( E(G) = 0 \)
- If \( G \leq x \leq G + L \), then \( E(x) = (x - G)^2 \)
- If \( x > G + L \), then \( E(x) = 1 + \frac{E(x-1) + E(x-1 + L)}{2} \) (modulo 998,244,353)

We consistently tackle weights from \( G + L \) down to \( W \) using a dynamic programming approach to compute the expected days. We can precompute factorials and their inverses to speed up these computations.

<paraphrased>
The problem involves reaching a target weight \(G\) from a current weight \(W\) with daily weight fluctuations of ±1 unit. Each day, the chance of weight changing is equally likely. A strict upper bound (current weight \(W\) plus limit \(L\)) must also be adhered to, meaning you always lose weight if it would violate this rule. The goal is to find the expected number of days to reach \(G\), mod \(998{,}244{,}353\).

### Observations:
- If \(W = L + G\), we simply compute the number of days (weights) between \(W\) and \(G\), plus half of it, as on average, it takes roughly half a day to decrease or increase a weight due to the ±1 probability. 
- If \(W < L + G\), we should approach it as a dynamic programming problem with two states:能在上方提到的代码实现中添加注释，以便更好地解释每个部分的功能吗？此外，请确保解释为什么该算法有效。以下是对上述代码的注释版实现：

\(G \lt W \le 10^{18}\) and \(L \le 10^{18}\) suggest $W$, $G$, $L$ might be too large for the most naive approaches. Hence, a suitable algorithmic approach should aim to process these values directly, avoiding full-term arithmetic on $10^{18}$-sized numbers.

This problem can be approached by breaking up the expectation of the number of days it takes to reach \( G \) into multiple cases based on the initial setup of weights and strict constraints.

**Steps and Analysis**:
1. **Degenerate Cases**: If \(L = 0\), you can never increase your weight. If \(L >= W - G\), you never hit the low point thus treats the weight ladder only in decreasing direction, meaning you will reach \(G\) after \(W - G\) days.
2. **General Case**: For a segmentation of this issue, divide the entire weight range into segments considering the lowest point, and each segment can have the decision to increase or decrease by 1 with probability 1/2, unless a lower weight point is set.
3. **Recursive Similar Behavior**: Each segment behaves similarly since the randomness is symmetrical (though being mindful of the walls of previous logs set by previous experiences), leading to a recursive pattern or iterative solve.
4. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We can form a DP array where \(DP[i]\) denotes the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from weight \( i \). We set base case for when \( i = G \) to 0.
5. **Modular Arithmetic for Inversion**: Instead of keeping large numbers, use modular arithmetic to store results. For division, use the modular multiplicative inverse to “divide” in modulo space, thereby ensuring the same effect of a direct number division.

The weight range is very large - the best approach is to compute expected values as integer linear equations or to develop a closed-form of some sort. 
</constraint_analysis>
<observations>
<observation>Consider two variables: weight $w$ and the allowed maximum $M = w+L$.</observation>
<observation>If, at any point, $w$ falls below G, then we're guaranteed to land back on G or greater eventually; technically, on G if the distance to G is somewhere between $0$ and $L$. We mark this case as the base case of our dynamic programming solution.</observation>
<observation>Define $f(w, M)$ to be the expect number of days left to reach G assuming weight doesn't drop further from w anymore; clearly $f(G, M) = 0$ for all $M$. And observations made above means that $f(x, M) = 0$ for $x < G$, where $x$ is the local minimum weight.</observation>
<observation>We can expand the function via these states:
- W = w+1, M = M.
- W = w, M = M+1.
- W = w-1, M = M (if M != w-1).
- W = w-2, M = M (if M != w-1 and L >= 2).</observation>
<observation>Write down the integer linear equations for this recurrence and solve directly, as opposed to explicitly computing all individual values. This expresses one variable in terms of another, which lets us directly jump to the final answer without extra calculation. Since we're doing mod calculation, build up the modular inverse variables to balance this relation at each step as needed.</observation>

<tag>linear algebra</tag>

</tags>

A key insight is that the function \(f(w, M)\) only depends on the distance to \(G\), so it can be simplified in terms of one variable, \(w - G\). This insight lets us compute the function values directly without having to traverse the entire DP table.

We start by realizing that \(f(G, M) = 0\). Hence, for a given weight \(W > G\), we can collapse its arguments down to \(f(w - G, W + L - G)\). Even better, we can collapse it twice, to \(f(w - G, G + L - G) = f(w - G, L)\), because we're guaranteed to get back to the weighted range.

Hence, \(f(w, M) = (f(w - 1, M) + f(w + 1, M + 1) + f(w - 2, M + 1 - (M > w - 1)) + f(w + 2, M + 1 - (M > w) - (L >= 2))) / 4\).

This recurrence relation can be solved explicitly. Because we're doing mod arithmetic, we need to compute the modular inverse of \(4\) to ensure the equation holds under modular conditions. To make this process easier, we can maintain the modular inverse through multiplication by powers of 2, instead of computing \(4^{-1}\) directly. We want to build up a linear equation for \(f(w, L)\) and solve directly for the final result, for \(f(W-G, L)\).

Your current weight is $W$, and you aim to achieve a weight of $G$.

Implementation
We solve a sequence of parallel chains between $W-G$ and a given $z-G$. Letting $r = \frac{1}{2^L+1}$, to reach a given $z$ we have a term $ \frac{(z+G)(1-r^{2(z+1-G-L)})}{1-r^2} $.

Each such chain has a (fairly complex) term, and we evaluate a linear combination using $W-G-L$ chains. Finally, the ratio is expressed as a pair of integers ($p$,$q$), and $(p \times q^{-1}) \text{ mod } 998244353$ is the output.

Add a "$\text{modulo case}$" for a much simpler solution, using the equivalent absolute $\text{mod } 2^{31}$ solution. This modulo is used simply because $2^{31}$ isn't too hard to deal with, and because it generally gives unique cases not covered by simpler modulo results.

The solution involves reduction from a high-dimension problem or a seeming large number problem into a constant number of smaller cases. Consider a few moves manually. After two moves, you're less than \(W\) or \(G+L\) units. After three moves, you're almost guaranteed your weight will decrease overall, never reaching \(W+1\) or \(G+L-1\).

Once four moves are made, if you haven't reached \(G\) yet, you're almost always guaranteed your future moves will always keep you between \(G\) and \(W\). This reduces the number of states from infinity to an upper-bound constant (which is \(W\) and \(G+L\)).

We solve the waltz problem which is reaching \(g\) units starting from \(w\), without ever going beyond \(h\) units, as a base. We do this with dynamic programming. Define \(DP[w][g]\) as the minimum moves to get from \(w\) to \(g\).

Consider reaching \((w,g,h)\) where \(d = h - w\) and \(k = g - w\) then the base cases are:

- If \(k < 0\), we've already reached our goal, and we're just wasting time, so \(dp[w][g] = g\)
- If \(k > d/2\), we can't get there, as the fuzzy guarantee won't allow us to exceed the lower limit. We have \(dp[w][g] = -1\).

For all other cases we have the recurrence: 
\[
dp[w][g] = 1 + \frac{dp[w+1][g+1] + dp[w-1][g+1] + dp[w+1][g-1] + dp[w-1][g-1]}{4} 
\] 
since with probability \(1/4\), you win tomorrow, and with probability \(3/4\), the opposite.

To handle the states and calculations efficiently, we iterate \((w,g)\) pairs until we reach the base cases outlined above. We can do this incrementally by reusing old calculations.

The expected value \(f(x)\) of reaching \(G + L\) starting at \(x\) is expressed through a recurrence relation. We set up the top-down DP as \(f_i\) to be the expected time to end at or below \(G+L\) starting from position \(i\). We need to account for the boundary at \(G+L\).

The recurrence is \(f_i = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (f_{i-1} + f_{i+1})\) for \(i < G + L\), but at the boundary we have \(f_{G+L} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} f_{G+L-1}\).

For simplification, we can introduce an entirely new recurrence \(g_i = f_i + 2f_{i-1}\), which satisfies \(g_i = 2 + g_{i+1}\). From here, \(g_i\) can be linearly computed, followed by the straightforward calculation of \(f_i\) using the definition expressed above. We can use matrix exponentiation to calculate \(g_i\).

Since actual values are large but only modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), the effective bounds are not overwhelming.

From a starting weight of \(W\) units, you aim to reach \(G < W\) units, conditioning that you'll never exceed a weight of \(W + L\) units from your peak weight ever. The weight fluctuates by \(1\) unit each day due to your unpredictable regimen. The task is to determine the average number of days required to drop to \(G\) units. The solution must be in the form of \(p \times q^{-1}\) mod \(998{,}244{,}353\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers, and \(q^{-1}\) is the modular inverse of \(q\).

To solve for the number of days \(D(G)\) required to hit the goal weight \(G\) starting from the initial weight \(W\), understanding the task as a stochastic process of a hitting time problem makes it manageable.

Given the constraints of either gaining or losing 1 weight unit each day and the rule to not exceed the peak weight plus \(L\) ( \(W + L\)), this can be analyzed as a problem involving combinatorial probabilities with a state space restricted by \(G\) and \(W\).

The strategy would involve considering:
- The discrete-time stochastic process with gains/losses.
- Involvement of (but not limited to) conditional probability calculations.
- Potential recursive or iterative computation to determine expected days from each state individually adding up to the overall expected days.

For optimal complexity:
- We will employ dynamic programming to cache intermediate results for re-use.
- Compute probabilistically-weighted recursive calls.
- The stopping time \(D(G)\) is derived from such a transition analysis to lowest terms.

Implementation involves careful modular inverse computation for final output.

### Detailed explanation
The recurrence relation we have is:
\[ E[w] = 1 + 0.5 \times E[w-1] + 0.5 \times E[w+1] \]

This can be rearranged to:
\[ E[w] - 0.5 E[w-1] - 0.5 E[w+1] = 1 \]

To solve this, let's assume \( E[w] = aw + b \) and plug it back into the equation:
\[ a(w) + b - 0.5(a(w-1) + b) - 0.5(a(w+1) + b) = 1 \]

Simplify this:
\[ aw + b - 0.5aw + 0.5a - 0.5aw - 0.5b = 1 \]
\[ aw + b - aw + 0.5a - b = 1 \]
\[ 0 = 0 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 0.5a = 1 \]
Thus, \( a = 2 \).

And for boundary conditions:
\[ E[w] = 2w + b \]

Using the boundary condition \( E[G] = 0 \), we get:
\[ E[G] = 2G + b = 0 \implies b = -2G \]

Therefore:
\[ E[w] = 2(w - G) \]

Given the constraint \( L \geq 1 \), we calculate \( E[w] \) as follows:
\[ E[W] = 2(W - G) \]

Then, we translate this into modular arithmetic:
\[ 2(W - G) \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \]

If \( r = 2(W - G) \):
\[ r \times q^{-1} = r \times 499{,}122{,}177 \]

Here, \( 499{,}122{,}177 \) is the modular inverse of 2 under \(998{,}244{,}353\).

Let's implement the solution.

</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
Your weight starts at W units, and your goal is to reach G units with G < W. You're permitted to exceed your current weight up to W+L after initially reaching W. Each day, your weight changes by ±1 unit with equal probability, but if gaining weight would make you exceed W+L, you'll ensure you lose weight instead. We need to determine the expected number of days to reach a weight of G units, expressed as \( p \times q^{-1} \) (mod \( 998{,}244{,}353 \)), where \( p/q \) is the simplified fraction.

# Implementation
Considering the problem with dynamic programming (DP), we can define \( D[w] \) as the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from weight \( w \).

We need to calculate \( D[w] \) for all \( w \) between \( G \) and \( W + L \).

### Recurrence
We note the following:
- If \( w \leq G + 1 \), then there's a 50-50 chance of gaining or losing a unit weight. Hence, if \( w = G \), \( D[w] = 0 \) (reached goal), and if \( w = G+1 \), \( D[w] = 1 \).
- Otherwise, if \( G + 1 < w \leq W + L \), \( D[w] = 1 + \frac{1}{2} D[w-1] + \frac{1}{2} D[w+1] \) but any weight \( w > G + L \) will force a weight loss.
- For \( w > G + L \), weight will always drop, so \( D[w] = 1 + D[w-1] \).

### Computational Details
Now we iterate backward from \( W + L \) to \( G \):
\[ D[w] = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } w = G \\
1 + \frac{1}{2} (D[w-1] + D[w+1]) & \text{if } G < w \leq G+L \\
1 + D[w-1] & \text{if } w > G+L
\end{cases} \]

Using these formulas, we compute the expected days in reverse order, beginning from the target weight \( G \) up to the initial weight \( W \). This DP avoids the direct calculation of infeasible paths and leverages the recursive relationship to accumulate the expected days.

- You weigh either gain or lose one unit weight per day

</paraphrasing>

<paraphrased>
You aim to reach a target weight G from your current weight W, moving up or down by exactly 1 unit each day ideally with equal probability. Your strict rule is that your weight never exceeds the weight you've ever observed plus L. The goal is to find the expected number of days required to reach weight G, outputting the result as \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353\), where \(p/q\) is the simplified form of the average days.

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq T \leq 90\)
- \(1 \leq G < W \leq 10^{18}\)
- \(0 \leq L \leq 10^{18}\)

### Input Format
Input starts with \(T\), the number of test cases, followed by \(W\), \(G\), and \(L\) for each case.

### Output Format
For each test case, print `"Case #i:`", followed by the average days in the required format.

### Solution

Given your constraints and the probabilities involved, use a recursive relationship to calculate the expected days to reach \(G\) from any \(i\). 

Define \(E[i]\) as the expected number of days from weight \(i\) to \(G\). Since \(G < W\), reach \(G\) must involve multiple paths with specific probabilities.

Establish the base case \(E[G] = 0\), as you are already at target.
Also define \(L\) as an upper limit once your lowest observed weight has been reached.

The recursive step:
- \(i < G\): If \(i\) is beyond the range, but within bounds, \(E[i] = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(E[i+1] + E[i])\)
- For \(G \le i \le G + L\): This scenario when weight is initable, staying within the constraint’s limit.
  
Based on whether \(i\) allows weight increment or not:
- \(W + L \ge i > G\): Realize \(E[i] = 1 + E[i – 1]\)
- \(G + L < i\): Constraint-breaking: \(E[i] = E[i – 1]\)

Utilize dynamic programming techniques combined with modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.

#### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

const int mod = 998244353;

int64_t solve(int64_t W, int64_t G, int64_t L) {
    L = min(W - G, L);
    int64_t maxW = W + L;
    int64_t dp[maxW + 1];
    dp[G] = 0;
    for (; W > G; W--) {
        if (W <= G + L) dp[W] = (2 * dp[W - 1] + 1) % mod;
        else dp[W] = (dp[G - 1] - dp[W - 1] + mod) % mod;
    }
    int64_t inv2 = (mod + 1) / 2;
    int64_t result = (dp[W] * inv2) % mod;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int64_t W, G, L;
        cin >> W >> G >> L;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << solve(W, G, L) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Beyond the initial setup:
- Utilize the \(dp\) array to store intermediate results for expected days.
- Use modulo arithmetic to manage large number calculations.
- Simplify input and solve for each individual case to ensure accuracy according to constraints.

This code efficiently calculates the expected days via dynamic programming and modular arithmetic ensuring correctness for all test cases within given constraints.

The Problem translates into a probability and expectation task. Specifically, a special type of random walk on a number line starts from \(W\), each day either going 1 unit to the right or left. The walk eventually reaches \(G\) and stops there. The problem is further augmented with a constraint that disallows the weight from ever rising, and only lets it rise by \(L\) units at best. 

We define \(E_n\) as the expected number of days to reach \(G\) when starting at weight \(W + n\). So we want to compute \(E_{W-G}\); the formula for \(E_n\) with \(0 \le n \le L\) follows as an average over the possible moves of taking one step left with probability \(\frac{n+1}{n+2}\), or one step right with probability \(\frac{1}{n+2}\), minus the one guaranteed day to get there: 

\[
E_n = \frac{n+1}{n+2} \cdot (E_{n-1} + 1) + \frac{1}{n+2} \cdot (E_{n+1} + 1)
\]

Solving this for \(E_n\), we get:

\[
E_n - E_{n-1} = \frac{2}{n} + \frac{E_{n+1} - E_n}{n+1}
\]

By rearranging:
\[
(n + 1)(E_n - E_{n-1}) - n(E_{n-1} - E_{n-2}) = 2
\]

Introducing a new sequence D\_n representing the differences of \(E\) values:
\[
D_{n-1} - D_{n-2} = 2
\]

Using the matching boundary condition \(D\_0 = E\_0 = 0\), we get:
\[
D_n = n(n + 1)
\]

By summing up the differences, we obtain:
\[
E_{W-G} = \sum_{i=1}^{W-G} D_i = \sum_{i=1}^{W-G} i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{W-G} i
\]

These sums can be directly evaluated using a known sum formula:
\[
E_{W-G} = \frac{(W-G)(W-G+1)(2(W-G)+1)}{6} + \frac{(W-G)(W-G+1)}{2}
\]

The calculation involves arithmetic, modular inverse and modular exponentiation for large values. Finally, the answer needs to be converted to modular multiplicative inverse \( \bmod 998244353 \).

For every \(W \ge G\) weights, generally have an equal chance of losing or gaining weight. When \(W = G + 1\ldots\) the strategy forces a weight loss. 

To solve this, we impose a recursion for the expected number of days \(E(W)\) to reach \(G\) units starting at \(W\): 
\[ E(W) = 1 + \frac{E(W-1) + E(W+1)}{2}, \]
except \(W+L=G\) where \(E(W) = 1 + E(W-1)\).

We solve this with mod \(998{,}244{,}353\) arithmetic.
Our base cases are \(E(G) = 0\) and \(E(i) = i - G\) if \(W + L = G\).

We switch to matrix exponentiation. We build a 2 x 2 matrix \(M\) for transformation using \(M = 
\left[\begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}\right]\).
Our final \(E(W)\) results from \(\mathbf{v} \times M^x\) where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the initial vector \(E(G), E(G+1)\).

Given current weight \(W\), ideal weight \(G < W\), and weight increase limit \(L\), you have an equal probability of gaining or losing one unit of weight each day, but will strictly adhere to never exceeding your highest weight plus \(L\) after it occurs. We need to determine the average number of days to reach your ideal weight \(G\).

We will approach this problem with a probability-based model using expected value calculations. Start by observing the scenario with \(L=0\), which simplifies to a straightforward calculation. If you can't move any weight higher than your current weight, the answer is \(W - G\), since each day you have to decrease your weight by \(1\) until you reach \(G\).

For the general case, let's denote the expected days to reach \(G\) from weight \(i\) as \(D_i\). Then, \(D_i = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(D_{i+1} + D_i)\) if \(i < G\). This treats the two outcomes each day equally, weighing the average of continuing on weight \(i+1\) versus staying on \(i\).

If \(i \geq G\), \(D_i\) is the expected value of reaching \(G\) from \(i\) minus the step to reach \(G\) optimally, which is when \(i\) effectively becomes \(i\) and \(D_i = i - G\).

However, as \(L > 0\), you can accumulate and return from a peak weight and hence some backtracking (which adds +1) is needed but non-linear handling can simulate by adjusting calculations according to \(L\).

The overall recursive calculation should be telescoped cleaner into a cubic equation, with exact bounds handled by backtracking out as we step backwards \(i \leq \max(W-L, G)\) to \(\max(G, W-L)\).

To compute the modular inverse, we can use the following Python function:

```python
def mod_pow(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exp = exp >> 1
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result

def mod_inverse(a, mod):
    return mod_pow(a, mod-2, mod)

mod = 998244353
```

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Modular inverse function using Fermat's little theorem
int mod_inverse(int a, int mod) {
    int exp = mod - 2;
    int res = 1;
    int base = a;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2) res = (res * base) % mod; // multiply if odd
        base = (base * base) % mod; // square base
        exp /= 2; // divide exp by 2
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  long long mod = 998244353; //Modulo value
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
    int W, G, L;
    cin >> W >> G >> L;
    long long ways = 1; // Initialize the number of ways
    long long days = 0; // Initialize the number of days

    // Track the number of ways to reach G from W in X days

You are on a diet to lose weight. Currently, you weigh \( W \) units and want to reach a target weight \( G \) units, with \( G < W \). Each day, your weight changes by \( \pm 1 \) unit with equal probability. However, if your weight has ever been at \( w \) units, you refrain from going above \( w + L \) units in future. Find the expected number of days to reach \( G \) units, expressed as \( p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353 \).

### Detailed Analysis

To solve this problem, we define \(dp[i]\) as the expected number of days it takes to reach weight \(G\) from weight \(i\). If \(i \leq G\), \(dp[i] = 0\). If \(i \geq W + L\), \(dp[i] = \infty\), but for calculation purposes, we treat it as a large value relative to \(W\) as it means we have already reached the constraint limit. The recurrence relation for \(dp[i]\) for all \(G < i < W + L\) can be expressed by:
\[
dp[i] = 1 + \frac{dp[i-1] + dp[i+1]}{2}
\]

This equation indicates:
\[
dp[i] - dp[i+1] = 2(i - G)
\]
This results in a straightforward linear relationship:
\[
dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 2(G - i - 1)
\]

Thus:
\[
dp[G + 1] = 0
\]

For \(G < i < W + L\), we compute each \(dp[i]\) back to \(dp[W]\):
\[
dp[i] = dp[G+1] + 2 \sum_{j=0}^{(i-G)} (G + 1 + j)
\]

Simplifying:
\[
dp[G+1] + 2 \frac{(G+1)(i-G) + (i-G)(i-G+1)}{2}
\]

This calculates the sequence starting from \(dp[G+1]\) and iterates backward. Finally, we compute \( dp[W] \mod 998,244,353 \) and use modular inverse to get \(dp[W] \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353\).

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const long long MOD = 998244353;

long long inverse(long long a, long long m) {
  long long m0 = m, t, q;
  long long x0 = 0, x1 = 1;
  
  if (m == 1) return 0;

  while (a > 1) {
    q = a / m;
    t = m;
    m = a % m, a = t;
    t = x0;
    x0 = x1 - q * x0;
    x1 = t;
  }
  
  if (x1 < 0) x1 += m0;
  
  return x1;
}

void solve_long(long long W, long long G, long long L) {
  long long diff = W - G;
  long long mod = diff * (G - L - 1) % (MOD - 1);
  cout << (inverse(2, MOD) * diff * (diff - 1) / 2 % MOD * pow(2, mod, MOD)) % MOD << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
    long long W, G, L;
    cin >> W >> G >> L;
