A number is considered an \(N\)-subtractorization if it is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference of two primes, both of which are at most \(N\). The task is to find how many such \(N\)-subtractorizations exist for a given \(N\).

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to identify all prime numbers up to \(N\) and then check which differences of these primes (where both primes are at most \(N\)) can be another prime. We'll leverage the knowledge that if \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) are primes, and \(p_3\) is the difference (\(p_1 - p_2\)), \(p_3\) must also be a prime and should be less than \(p_2\).

A useful observation is that if \(N\) is large, the list of primes up to \(N\) can be quite long, making a brute-force check impractical. However, the key primes that form subtractorizations can often be inferred directly, such as the number \(2\), which is the difference of \(3\) and \(5\), and so on.

1. Generate all primes up to \(N\).
2. Check each prime \(P\) to see if \(P\) can be expressed as the difference of any other primes in our list.
3. Track which primes qualify as subtractorizations.
4. Generate the result accordingly.

If \(N\) is small, we can afford to check differences directly, but large \(N\) requires recognizing patterns in prime differences.

Finally, considering the constraints and efficiency required:

Primes less than 10000000 include: 2, 3, 5, 7, ... and so forth, up to the 664,579th prime. For each prime, we ensure to check for any other primes that form a valid subtractorization pattern.

A simple program that counts the number of N-subtractorizations primarily relies on generating all primes up to \(N\) and then checking which of these primes can be expressed as the difference of two primes. Here are the key steps to achieve this efficiently:

1. **Generate Primes**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to list all primes up to \(N\).
2. **Check Differences**: For each prime \(p \leq N\), check if there are two other primes \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(q - r = p\).
3. **Simplify Counting**: For a large \(N\), realize that considering only the largest gaps between primes can simplify the task.

One optimization is to realize that if \(N\) is larger, only the primes closer to \(N\) matter for differences, reducing the number of calculations. However, a full Sieve approach followed by a straightforward check remains simple and effective due to the constraint size.

# Implementation:
Utilizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes, followed by a direct check for each prime if it fits the definition of an N-subtractorization.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int T;
int N;
bool isPrime[10000003];

// Sieve of Eratosthenes
void sieve(int N) {
    fill(&isPrime[2], &isPrime[N + 1], true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int p = 2; p * p <= N; ++p) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            for (int i = p * p; i <= N; i += p)    isPrime[i] = false;
        }
    }
}

int findSubtractorizations(int N) {
    sieve(N);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = 2; j + i <= N; ++j) {
                if (isPrime[j] && isPrime[j + i]) {
                    cnt++;
                    break; // Only one dif is required for i
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}

int main() {
    cin >> T;
    for (int i = 1; i <= T; ++i) {
        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << i << ": " << findSubtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The above program first generates all primes up to N. For each prime \(i\), it then checks if there is a valid prime \(j\) that satisfies the condition \(j+i \leq N\) and both \(j\) and \(j+i\) are primes. Once the condition is met for any \(j\), the counter is incremented, and it moves to the next prime \(i\).

This ensures the solution is efficient and handles the constraints properly.


Completion 4:
================================================================================
- Count the number of positive integers that are prime and expressible as the difference of two primes at most N.
- To be a subtractorization, the integer should be prime and can be formed by subtractions of two other primes that are atmost N.
- For example, in N=8, the answer is 3 as 2 (8-6), 3 (8-5) and 5 (13-8) are the valid subtractorizations.
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
To find the number of $N$-subtractorizations, we need to identify all prime numbers less than or equal to \(N\) that can be expressed as the difference of two other prime numbers, both also at most \(N\).

First, the solution involves generating all prime numbers up to \(N\). Then, we can check each prime number to see if it can be written as the difference \(p_1 - p_2\) of two primes \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) (with \(p_1 \le N\) and \(p_2 \le N\)). For this to work, \(p_1 = p_2 + d\) where \(d\) should also be prime, as we are dealing with prime differences.

The steps entail:
- Sieve of Eratosthenes or another efficient prime generation method
- For each prime difference, ensure both the original and the difference are prime
- Count these subtractorizations
</paraphrased>
<observation>
Implied from the explanation: The highest prime, \(p_1\), will always be closer to \(N\) and the lower prime, \(p_2\), will be \(p_1 - d\) where \(d\) is a prime as well.

```
1. Generate primes using Sieve up to N
2. For each prime p1:
   - For each prime p2 (p2 <= p1):
     - Check if p1 - p2 is also a prime
     - If so, p1 is a valid subtractorization
3. Count and report the number of such subtractorizations

Completion 5:
================================================================================
We need to find all prime numbers which are difference of 2 primes (both at most N), and the first such prime in the list of primes is 2 (because 3-1=2 and 5-3=2)
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many prime numbers can be expressed as the difference of two prime numbers, both of which are at most \(N\). The smallest prime number that can be expressed in such a way is \(2\). Further, if \(N \ge 5\), the prime number \(5\) can also be an \(N\)-subtractorization since it can be written as \(7 - 2\) or \(13 - 8\) (the last expression isn't truly valid as \(8\) is not a prime number but the first one is valid). Similarly, for \(N \ge 7\), the prime number \(7\) can be expressed as the difference of two primes in multiple ways.

Based on the above observations, we can infer that:
1. For \(N < 5\), the only N-subtractorization is 2.
2. For \(N \geq 5\), the N-subtractorizations include 2, 3, and 5.
3. For \(N \ge 11\), 7 also becomes an N-subtractorization.

#### Handling the general case

1. If \( N < 4 \), return `0` since there's no N-subtractorization.
2. Else if \( N \) is between 4 (inclusive) to 7 \( N \le 7 \) (inclusive), return `2` (primes: 2, 3).
3. Else if \( N \) is between 8 (inclusive) to 10 (inclusive), return `3` (primes: 2, 3, 5).
4. Else return `4` (primes: 2, 3, 5, 7).

Let's formalize this in a piecewise-defined function.

To count the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* for a given \(N\), we need to find all prime numbers that can be represented as the difference of two primes, both of which do not exceed \(N\). We aim to do this efficiently given the large maximum value for \(N\).

### Analysis:
The prime numbers used must be small enough not to exceed \(N\) and should fit the definition criteria.

### Approach:
1. Generate a list of primes up to \(N\).
2. For each pair of primes within \(N\) (primes \(p_1\) and \(p_2\)), check if \(p_1 - p_2\) results in a prime number.
3. Count the unique results. Ensure no duplicate numbers are counted.

### Implementation:
The steps to achieve the desired output involve the Sieve of Eratosthenes to sieve out all primes up to N. From this list, we generate valid subtractorization numbers and count them.
```python
from math import sqrt
from collections import defaultdict

# Sieve of Eratosthenes

                primes[j] = False
    return [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(primes) if is_prime]

def solve(N):
    primes = sieve(N)
    subtractorizations = set()
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            result = primes[i] - primes[j]
            if result <= 0:
                break
            if result in primes and result > 0:
                subtractorizations.add(result)
    return len(subtractorizations)

### General Explanation:
1. **Generate Primes:** Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to \(N\).
2. **Check Differences:** For each pair of primes identified, calculate the difference. If the difference is positive, prime, and does not exceed \(N\), add the difference to the set of *$N$-subtractorizations*.
3. **Count Distinct Solutions:** Count the unique differences which provide the answer.

By trying both cases in parallel as supported by the sieve and existing pre-generated sets, ensures that the solutions produced are efficient and accurate, leveraging the structure of prime generation and checking via set operations.

First, generate all primes up to \(N\), using a sieve to mark all non-prime numbers. For each prime \(p\), examine all primes \(q \le p\) and check if \(p-q\) is prime and within the range. Since we only care about prime numbers less than or equal to \(N\), we do not need to iterate all the way from \(2\) to \(N\). 

Store the unique values of \(p-q\). More efficient approaches involve using sets to get unique numbers and count them with a counter. 

An efficient approach employs the observation that any prime for which there exists a difference of two prime numbers under \(N\) must be part of the set \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, ...\}\). Hence, iterating only over the precomputed primes will suffice.

Generating all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and then counting how many valid differences exist is the key approach. For each prime \(p\) less than or equal to \(N\), find if \(N-p\) is also a prime, and count those instances.

# Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

// Function to generate all primes up to N using Sieve of Eratosthenes
vector<int> gen_primes(int N) {
    bitset<10000005> is_prime;
    vector<int> primes;
    is_prime.set();
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i])
            primes.push_back(i);
        for (auto p: primes) {
            int n = p * i;
            if (n > N) break;
            is_prime[n] = false;
            if (i % p == 0) break;
        }
    }
    return primes;
}

// Function to solve a single test case
int count_subtractorizations(int N) {
    auto primes = gen_primes(N);
    bitset<10000005> prime_set;
    for (auto p: primes) 
        prime_set[p] = true;

    int count = 0;
    for (int p : primes) {
        if (prime_set[N - p])
            count++;
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": ";
        cout << count_subtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This solution leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to \(N\) and uses those primes to efficiently determine how many *$N$-subtractorizations* exist.

For a given $N$, an *$N$-subtractorization* is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference of two primes, each of which is no larger than $N$. For instance, for $N=5$, the set of *$N$-subtractorizations* is $\{2, 3\}$ since both $5 - 3 = 2$ and $5 - 2 = 3$ hold.

<observation>A prime difference of $2$ arises from the pair $3, 5$. From $5$ onwards, we get successive differences of $2$ from a pattern of odd primes unless the next larger prime skip is $6$ or more, as in prime pairs differ by $6$, like $7$ and $13$.</observation>
<observation>When $N \leq 100$ (aka \(N\) is not massive), contrary to the initial conjecture, *N-subtractorizations* can terminate early. For instance, if $N = 9$, unlike $\{2, 3, 5, 7\}$, the correct *N-subtractorizations* are $\{2, 3, 5\}$ as $N$ does not extend further up to include $7$ from the prime differences list.</observation>
<observation>For $N > 100$, results follow the pattern of all odd primes up to $N$ being *N-subtractorizations* with some exceptions very early on in the sequence of primes.

For a given \(N\), we will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to \(N\). We then check for each prime \(d\), if there exist two primes that satisfy \(p_i - p_j = d\).

Here's the breakdown of the implementation steps:
- First, a Sieve function to generate all primes up to \(N\).
- Keeping primes up to \(N\) in an array for fast access.
- Using the generated primes to check if there are pairs \(p, q\) where \(p - q = d\) and \(p, q \leq N\).

Since we're dealing with large inputs, we would pre-generate the primes only once for each \(N\). After primes are generated, we iterate only through the prime numbers up to \(N\) and check the conditions efficiently.

# Implementation

            int diff = primes[i] - primes[j];
            if (diff < 2) break; // Since primes[0] = 2 and cannot form a valid pair with smaller or equal primes
            if (sieve[diff])
                count++;

For each \(N\), we first generate the list of all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, for each prime number \(p \leq N\), we iterate through the primes \(q \leq p\) and determine if \(p - q\) is also a prime. We'll use a hashing approach to avoid counting duplicates (since we're interested in unique *$N$-subtractorization* values).

Another approach is to build a set of valid \(N\)-subtractorization values and map each prime pair's difference to the set. This ensures that only unique values are considered.

Below is an efficient C++ implementation using Sieve of Eratosthenes and hashing for \(\mathcal{O}(N \log \log N)\) complexity in prime generation and \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\) for checking and collecting unique values.

This code efficiently enumerates *$N$-subtractorizations* and avoids unnecessary computations. 

### Explanation:
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Generates all primes up to \(N\).
2. **Hashing for Difference Primes**: Stores valid *$N\)-subtractorizations* as unique differences.
3. **Optimized Iteration**: Ensures the solution is computationally feasible within the constraints.

Since an *$N$-subtractorization* condition is that it should be a difference of two primes within \(1\) to \(N\) and should be a prime itself, any *$N$-subtractorization* must be an even number (since the difference of two odd numbers is even, and the only even prime is 2). The possible exceptions are even numbers, hence the possibility primarily reduces to looking at the differences that can make 2. The highest such viable difference pair is \(N\) and \(N-2\) since both primes are within the range of \(1\) to \(N\), making \(N-N+2=2\). Since 2 is within the limit \(N\geq 2\), it is always one possible answer. However, for \(N=2\) the possible pair is \(2-2+0=0\), that is not prime, and therefore no such number can form, making the count \(0\).

Hence, the solution can be implemented in a simple if-else scenario based on the input \(N\).

To find the *$N$-subtractorizations*:
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to \(N+1\).
2. Recognize the prime differences can only occur as 2 (subtracting 2 & 3 in \( \{2, 3\} \)) or an even number.
3. Check if adding each prime difference (starting from 2 up to \(N-2\)) to 2, and \(3\) results in a prime:
4. Differentiate for \(2\): the difference \(2 = 3 - 1\), but this includes \(1\) which isn’t prime, so only include if it's directly possible with available primes.

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sieveOfEratosthenes(int N, vector<bool>& isPrime) {
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not primes
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i] == true) {
            for (int j = i * 2; j <= N; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
    vector<bool> isPrime(N + 1, true);
    sieveOfEratosthenes(N, isPrime);
    
    int count = 0;
    isPrime[1] = false; // Reset case involving non-prime diffs.
    if (N >= 2) count += (isPrime[2] && isPrime[3]); // difference 1 special case
    
    for (int diff = 2; diff <= N - 2; diff += 2) {
        bool isEvenPrimeOk = isPrime[2 + diff] && (diff != 2);
        bool is3PrimeOk = isPrime[3 + diff];
        if (isEvenPrimeOk || is3PrimeOk) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int T;
    cin >> T;

        int N;
        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }

    return 0;

In the context of the problem, an \(N\)-subtractorization is defined as a prime number that can be subtracted from another prime number, both of which are at most \(N\), to yield this prime number. The task is to find the number of such \(N\)-subtractorizations given a certain \(N\).

Every $N$-subtractorization must be less than $N$ since a prime cannot be subtracted from itself.
</observation>

The parity (odd/even) of the $N$-subtractorization will be determined by the parity of $N$. If $N$ itself is prime, it can be an $N$-subtractorization if its parity is consistent with the possible primes less than $N$.

To find the count of $N$-subtractorizations:
1. Generate all primes up to $N$ using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each pair of these primes:
   - Check if their difference is also a prime and record it.
3. Count the unique $N$-subtractorizations found.

This utilizes efficient prime generation, avoiding the need to separately check primes below $N$ each time but ensuring all prime differences below $N$ are considered.

An integer is an $N$-subtractorization if it is a prime number and can be written as the difference between two prime numbers, both of which do not exceed $N$. For a given $N$, the goal is to count how many such numbers exist.

First, we will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to determine all prime numbers up to \(N\). During the sieve process, we mark each number as prime unless it's a multiple of a smaller number (and only then if that mark is kept). Then, we perform an auxiliary array marking numbers that are the difference of two primes up to \(N\), storing as a bitset (or boolean array) to keep space efficient.

Let's break this down:
- Precompute all primes up to N using Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- For each prime \(a \leq N\), check each prime \(b \leq N\) if \(a = b - x\), where \(x\) must be a prime integer (using the precomputed bitset).
- We keep a running count of all valid subtractorizations this way.

Implementation notes:
- Sieve of Eratosthenes will be used if we need to check if a number is prime within the range.
- We make a half-way check since \(a\) and \(b\) matter in the subtraction but only need to be considered once as the difference order is symmetric.

The problem requires checking for prime numbers and their differences with other primes within the range \(N\). A common approach is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to sieve out non-prime integers, then forming pairs of these primes and checking their differences. We count unique valid differences within limits.

```cpp

We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers up to \(N\) efficiently. Then, we can iterate over all pairs of these prime numbers and count how many differences result in another prime number.

Here’s how the solution steps could be outlined:
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to \(N\).

In the above code:
- `sieve` function generates prime numbers up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- `is_prime` checks if a number is prime using the generated sieve data.
- The main loop identifies all primes and counts valid differences.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> primes;

bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n <= 3) return true;
    
    if (!(n % 2 || n % 3)) return false;

    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) {
```

Please complete the code by implementing the `sieve` function and finishing the `is_prime` function. Then, integrate the solution to count the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* correctly in the `main` function.

- A positive integer is an *N-subtractorization* if it is a prime and can be expressed as the difference of two primes that are both at most $N$.
- Find the number of *N-subtractorizations* for a given $N$.
- Constraints: \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\).
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
To solve the problem, we define an *$N$-subtractorization* as a prime number that can be expressed as the difference of two primes less than or equal to $N$. We need to count these for a given $N$ under the constraints \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\).

For example, $\{2, 3\}$ are the *$5$-subtractorizations*, since $5 - 3 = 2$ and $5 - 2 = 3$. Similarly, $\{2, 3, 5\}$ are the *$8$-subtractorizations*.

Our approach involves:
1. Generate a list of all prime numbers up to $N$ using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Loop through this list to find all primes within $N$ and parallel lists to track differences.
3. Enumerate differences and adjust counts accordingly.

# Notes

We will use a sieve to generate primes efficiently. To efficiently implement the sieve, we need to maintain only the primes up to $N$ and use dynamic programming to store differences between primes. Iterate the list of primes, maintaining an array for differences. Use a greedy strategy to correctly capture the primes within $N$ and account for overlaps. The number of *$N$-subtractorizations* will be identified by counting amongst differences.

# Solution Approach

## Constraints and Notes

- Constraints permit a linear sieve for primes up to \(10{,}000{,}000\).
- We use a sieve to efficiently generate all primes in \(O(N \log \log N)\) time.
- Dynamic programming to track differences and correct overlaps in counts.

## Key Steps and Observations

- Identify all primes up to \(N\).
- Compute all valid *$N$-subtractorizations* using differences between primes.
- Keep track of overlapping cases and adjust counts appropriately.

### Example Pseudocode Implementation

Detailed steps and observations are relevant to the core logic.
Implement the sieve and process:
- Get primes up to $N$.
- Check differences to see if any $P = x - y$ (both x, y being primes \(\leq N\)).
- Adjust positive differences as part of the count towards valid *$N$-subtractorizations*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

  for (int num = 2; num <= N; ++num)
    sieve[num] = true;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; ++i)
    if (sieve[i])
      for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i)
        sieve[j] = false;
}

    cin >> N;
    for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) 
      if(sieve[i]) {
       primes.push_back(i);
        if (i < N) {
          for (int j = 0; j < primes.size() && primes[j] < N; j++) {
            int diff = primes[j] - primes[i];
            if (diff > 0 && sieve[diff]) count++;
          }
        }
      }
    cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << count << endl;
  }
  return 0;

```

Now, we can first generate all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, we can calculate all possible differences between pairs of primes \(p, q\) where \(p > q\) and store them. This pays off because once we know all such differences, we can quickly count how many of these differences are indeed primes. We create an array carrying the final count of how many such numbers exist, and keep it updated while processing through primes and differences.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000005;

bool is_prime[MAXN];
vector<int> primes;

void sieve() {
   fill(is_prime, is_prime + MAXN, true);
   is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;

            is_prime[i] = false;
   for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; ++i)
      if (is_prime[i])
         primes.push_back(i);
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
   vector<int> differences;
   for (int p : primes)
      if (p <= N) {
         for (int q : primes) {
            if (p > q && p - q <= N && is_prime[p - q])
               differences.push_back(p - q);
            }
      }
   int cnt[MIN(N, 5000001)];
   fill(cnt, cnt + MIN(N, 5000001), 0);
   for (int diff : differences)
      cnt[diff]++;

   int total = 0;
   for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) //iterate up to N
      if (is_prime[i] && cnt[i] > 0)
         ++total;
   return total;
}

int main() {
   int T;
   cin >> T;
   sieve();
   for (int t = 1; t <= T; ++t) {
      int N;
      cin >> N;
      cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
   }
   return 0;
}
```

**Note:** MIN() is a placeholder function assumed to be representing `min()`.

**Explanation of tuning choices:** The differences are only computed considering primes within the limit of \(10,000,000\) ensuring the runtime remains within bounds. Also, the count array `cnt` is sized effectively only till the minimum of \(N\) and the first 5000001 because any query beyond this would exceed practical and reasonable input/output limits as per problem constraints. The tuning effectively serves a dual purpose, optimization and limitations adherence.

If a prime p is between N/2 and N, then \(p - q\) is an N-subtractorization for any prime \(q \leq N\), and must by definition be prime since \(p - q < N\).

A segmented sieve will allow us to generate primes up to N in \(\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{\log \log N})\) time, along with a bitvector containing the potential N-subtractorizations in \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) space, sufficient to pass the constraints.

Let's explain how a segmented sieve works, considering how it could be useful for us. Given an interval, it generates only actual primes in that range while avoiding the overhead of designing and invalidating for the entire range. Specifically:

1. **Prime generation:** Based off an interval \([low, high]\) where \(low\) and \(high\) are both small integers.
2. **Bitvector restriction:** Instead of counting all elements, consider pruning once we reach the range \(i \leq \lceil N/2 \rceil\) corresponding to \(i - N \leq i / 2\), which jettison non-prime differences \(i - (i - N)\).

Now, let's describe the algorithm with example.

In this implementation, we first generate a vector of primes up to N using a standard sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, we create a set of subsequences (isSubtractor), mapping each candidate to whether it is an N-subtractorization depending on the prime differences up to N/2 due to optimality considerations. Finally, we count these N-subtractorizations.

The overall complexity of prime generation via a segmented sieve ensures efficiency, while we maintain O(N log log N) due to operations required for membership verification, culminating in a big O notation of \(\mathcal{O}(T(N+N/\log(N)))\).

We will maintain a set of primes up to \(N\) to efficiently generate their differences. For each prime \(x\), we will iterate over larger primes \(z\) from \(x+1\) to \(N\) and calculate their differences \(z-x\). If any difference \(z-x\) is a prime and lies within the range \(1\) to \(N\), we count it. We will use a sieve-based method to generate prime numbers up to \(N\).

We'll apply the Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently to generate primes up to \(N\), take differences, and filter the correct count of $N$-subtractization numbers.

The `generatePrimes` function efficiently generates a list of all prime numbers up to `N` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. After obtaining the list of primes, the `solve` function iterates over all pairs of these primes and calculates their differences, recording only unique differences (excluding singletons) that are also prime. This way, we adhere to the definition of an $N$-subtractorization and count such primes efficiently.

Finding the *$N$-subtractorizations* involves generating primes up to \(N\) and then computing their differences. Let's outline the steps:

1. Use a sieve to generate all primes up to \(N\).
2. For each prime \(P_1\), compute \(P_1 - P_2\) for all \(P_2 \leq P_1\) and check if the difference is prime.
3. Store unique differences in a set.
4. Output the size of the set as the count of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

A straightforward approach to sieve the primes in \(O(N \log \log N)\) would be efficient enough for the constraint \(N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\).

For \(N \leq 10million\), a direct approach to sieving all primes up to \(N\) followed by checking all pairs of primes is within feasible bounds for runtime constraints. The Sieve of Eratosthenes can generate all primes up to \(N\) in \(O(N \log \log N)\) operations while the quadratic time required to check pairs is still only \(O(N^2)\) which is feasible for the constraint.

<observation>The maximum difference possible is \(N\), but it's often less. For each prime \(p\), the possible primes \(q\) we loop through will reduce the loop count.</observation>

In order to efficiently compute the number of N-subtractorizations for a given \(N\), the following steps should be followed:

1. Compute all the primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each prime \(p\) up to \(N\), check all primes \(q\) up to \(N\) where \(p \ge q\) and \(p - q\) is a prime number and \(\le N\). Track those unique prime differences.
3. Count the number of unique primes that are found in the above process.

Given the constraints, these steps can be efficiently performed within an acceptable runtime. Due to the large upper limit (\(N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\)), the Sieve of Eratosthenes is ideal for generating primes. Here with each test case, we only have to recheck and count without generating prime numbers again.

# Implementation

```python
MAXN = 10000000
sieve = [True] * (MAXN + 1)
primes = []

def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            primes.append(i)
            for j in range(i*i, n + 1, i):
                sieve[j] = False

sieve_of_eratosthenes(MAXN)

def count_n_subtractorizations(N):
    unique_diffs = set()
    prime_numbs = [p for p in primes if p <= N]
    
    for i, p in enumerate(prime_numbs):
        for q in prime_numbs[:i+1]:
            diff = p - q
            if diff in prime_numbs and diff <= N:
                unique_diffs.add(diff)
    return len(unique_diffs)

T = int(input())
for t in range(1, T+1):
    N = int(input())
    result = count_n_subtractorizations(N)
    print(f"Case #{t}: {result}")
```

In the program above, we initially perform a sieve to generate all primes up to \(10{,}000{,}000\). For each test case, we then compute the *N-subtractorizations* for \(N\) in the input. Our function `count_n_subtractorizations` takes all primes up to \(N\) and finds unique differences that are also within the threshold of being a prime and ≤ \(N\).

We need to identify all the primes that will contribute to subtractorizations. Specifically, each prime \(p\) such that \(p\) and \(N-p\) are also primes is an \(N\)-subtractorization.

1. **Generate Primes:**
   - We need a list of all primes up to \(N\). We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes for this task. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm in \(\mathcal{O}(n \log \log n)\) time complexity.
2. **Identify Subtractorizations:**
   - Iterate over our set of primes and, for each prime, check if \(N - \text{prime}\) is also a prime.
   - Count all such instances.

The overall complexity will be approximately \(\mathcal{O}(N \log \log N)\), which is efficient for \(N\) up to \(10{,}000{,}000\).

An *$N$-subtractorization* is a prime number obtainable from the difference of two primes not exceeding $N$. Given $T$ test cases, each with an integer $N$, we must determine the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Pseudocode:
1. Define a function `is_prime(x)` to check if `x` is prime.
2. Create an array `sieve` size `N + 1` with `True` values.
3. Initialize `counted_primes` to `0`
4. Loop from `2` to `N`, if `sieve[i]` is `True`, mark non-primes, increment `counted_primes`.
5. Initialize `N_subtractorization` to `counted_primes` since the `0th` subtractorization is always counted.
6. Loop from `0` to `N`, set `prime_subtractorizations[prime_i]` to `False`.
7. Two For-loops to find prime pairs within `N` and check if their differences are within `N` and prime. Add to `N_subtractorizations` if so.
8. Return `N_subtractorizations`

From the definition, an $N$-subtractorization is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers, both of which are less than or equal to $N$.
To solve, we need to identify a pattern or method to enumerate such primes.
When $N$ is less than $4$, there are no $N$-subtractorizations, due to the properties of prime numbers and the fact that the smallest prime is 2.
Starting with $N = 4$, we observe that the set of $N$-subtractorizations grows in a predictable manner.
Specifically, we find that for $N \geq 4$, and every increment of $N$ by $2$, the count of $N$-subtractorizations increases by $1$, starting from $2$ for $N = 4$.
This is due to the inclusion of a new largest odd prime less than or equal to $N$ which can subtract from $N$ to produce new unique primes.
We leverage this to directly compute the count for any $N$ compactly.
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
An $N$-subtractorization is a prime number that can be written as the difference of two primes, both at most $N$. For $N$ less than $4$, there are none. For $N \geq 4$, the number of $N$-subtractorizations increases by $1$ each time $N$ increases by $2$, starting from $2$ at $N = 4$. This pattern allows for an efficient and direct calculation of the number without needing to check all possible pairs of primes.
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
\(N\) can be up to \(10{,}000{,}000\): Requires an efficient method that can scale to this size.
</constraint_analysis>
<observation>
For \(N < 4\), there are no valid $N$-subtractorizations because we lack sufficient primes to form valid differences.
For \(N \geq 4\), observing the pattern in the sample inputs provides insights into the count of $N$-subtractorizations.
Specifically:
- At \(N = 4\), the $4$-subtractorizations are \{2, 3\} resulting in a count of 2.
- For each subsequent even $N$ incrementing by 2, a previously excluded prime becomes valid, thus increasing the count by 1.
This points to a straightforward arithmetic approach rather than prime enumeration.
</observation>

For \(N \geq 4\), the number of $N$-subtractorizations is given by \(N/2 - 1\).

Let's explain why this works:
Since every odd prime number \(p\) (greater than 2) can subtract from an even \(N\) and yield another prime number, we need to account for how many such pairs can exist. For each such \(p\), there is a corresponding prime \(N - p\). The smallest such prime \(p\) is 3, so we have \(N-3\), \(N-5\), etc. Thus, the number of possible pairs is the number of odd integers from 3 up to \(N\), which is \(N/2 - 1\).

For \(N < 4\), the result is 0.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {

      cout << 0 << endl;
    } else {
      cout << N / 2 - 1 << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```


### Explanation
The code first reads \(T\), the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads \(N\), and uses a simple arithmetic formula to compute the number of $N$-subtractorizations, printing the appropriate value based on whether \(N\) is less than 4 or not.

An integer is an *N-subtractorization* if it is a prime and can be expressed as the difference of two primes that are both at most \(N\). For a given \(N\), we are tasked to count the number of N-subtractorizations.

For instance, for \(N = 5\), the primes less than 5 are {2, 3, 5}, and the valid differences are 5 - 3 = 2 and 5 - 2 = 3, making the N-subtractorizations {2, 3}. We need to solve this for various values of \(N\).

If \(N = 2\), the two primes both equal to 2, so the difference is 0. Since we are only interested in positive differences, \(N = 2\) has \(1\) N-subtractorization (\(3 - 2 = 1\)).

If \(N = 1\), there are no primes less than or equal to it, so there are \(0\) N-subtractorizations.

If N is any odd integer (> 2), all odd primes less than it are N-subtractorizations.

To determine the number of \(N\)-subtractorizations, we follow these simplified steps:

1. If \(N = 1\), return 0 as there are no primes ≤ 1.
2. If \(N = 2\), return 1 as the only N-subtractorization is 1 (\(2 - 1 = 1\)), since 2 is the only prime ≤ 2.
3. If \(N \ge 3\), count all odd numbers less than \(N\), starting from 3. These are N-subtractorizations.

Handling even \(N\) is similar except we need to recount for the prime N/2 if it's a prime.

Since we are only interested in the count of *$N$-subtractorizations*, we can break it down in such a way:

1. For \(N < 4\), the answer will always be 1 (from the prime number 2).
2. For \(N \geq 4\), the *$N$-subtractorizations* are the odd primes up to \(N\) (since the only even prime is 2, and the difference between two odd primes is even). Two primes differing by 2 means the smaller of the two is a prime like 3.

The preceding observations allow us to significantly reduce the computation complexity by not directly subtracting all primes. Integrations of prime counting techniques (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes) will make the computation more efficient.

To solve the problem, we will create a boolean list `sieve` to mark non-prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and another list `can_be_subtractorization` to keep track of all primes that can be *N-subtractorizations*. Here’s a method to find all primes up to N and to identify if a prime can be prime difference of two other primes.

We will first generate all the primes up to N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For each prime, we will check if there exists another prime \(q\) such that \(q > p\) and \(p = q - prime\). This implies checking if \(prime\) is the difference of any two primes. We store these in `can_be_subtractorization`.

To optimize the readability and correctness, here is the detailed step-by-step approach and corresponding code:

1. Use a boolean array `sieve` of size \(N + 1\), where `sieve[i]` being `True` implies \(i\) is a prime.
2. Apply the Sieve of Eratosthenes to set all prime indices.
3. For each prime \(p\) up to \(N\), check if there exists a prime \(q\) such that \(p = q - prime_i\), also ensuring that \(q \leq N\).
4. For such valid primes \(p\), mark them as valid *N-subtractorizations*.
5. Count the number of such primes marked in the `can_be_subtractorization` list.

### Solution Approach

1. Generate a bitset representing prime numbers up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Use the bitset to determine all possible prime differences \(p1 - p2\).
3. Use a second bitset to track prime differences that are themselves prime.
4. Output the count of unique *$N$-subtractorizations* obtained from these prime differences.

# Implementation

The following program does exactly that:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000000;

bitset<MAXN + 1> sieve, res;

void markNotPrime (int n) {
    for (int i = n * 2; i <= MAXN; i += n)
        sieve[i] = false;
}

void precompute (int n) {
    sieve.reset();
    sieve.set();
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)
        if (sieve[i])
            markNotPrime (i);
}

// This function checks if a range difference is prime and adds it to the result set.
void checkDifference(int p1, int p2, int& count) {
    int diff = p1 - p2;
    if (diff >= 2 && sieve[diff] && !res[diff]) {
        res[diff] = true;
        count++;
    }
}

// Input: N
// Output: The number of $N$-subtractorizations
int solve(int N) {
    precompute(N);
    int primeCount = 0;
    int count = 0;
    
    // Generate primes
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            primeCount++;
            // Check pairs (p1, i) for differences that are prime
            for (int j = i; j >= 2; --j) {
                if (sieve[j]) {
                    checkDifference(i, j, count);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << solve(N) << endl;
    }
}
```

This code efficiently calculates all *$N$-subtractorizations* by leveraging the Sieve of Eratosthenes and bit manipulation to minimize redundant checks. Each test input is processed independently to compute the desired output.

Positive integer P is an $N$-subtractorization if it is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference of two primes at most N.
Examples:

To determine the number of primes that can be expressed as the difference of two primes both at most \( N \):

1. Generate a list of prime numbers up to \(\left \lceil \frac{N}{2} \right\rceil\).
2. Generate a list of additional prime numbers within \(\left( \left \lceil \frac{N}{2} \right\rceil, N \right ]\).
3. Use these primes to check all possible prime differences \( \le N \).
4. Account for specific conditions where odd \(N\) and even \(N\) can give different prime counts.

**Example:**
For \(N = 5\):
- Smallest primes are 2, 3
- Primes up to \(3\): 2, 3
- Difference includes \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) and \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).
- Count of \( N \)-subtractorizations: 2

In code implementation, we use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to build a boolean array of primes and use efficient bounds for input handling.

The key here is to count all prime differences to a target number but only looking only in one direction. Prime filtering and checking at a reduced scale yields a quicktime solution. Pairs in other directions like \(N-x\) to \(x\) can be quickly explored but their count is less. Given a large \(N\), this helps significantly.

To solve this problem, we'll start by calculating all the prime numbers up to \(N\) using a sieve (taking advantage of the fact that prime generation only needs to be done once). With these primes, we can calculate the differences between all pair of primes to find all primes that can be expressed as a difference of two primes within the range \(\{1, 2, ..., N\}\).

Once we have these differences, we check if each difference is prime and track how many unique $N$-subtractorizations we have. The overall process requires the sieving and the differences to be precomputed so that we can run multiple cases efficiently.

For a given \(N\), we can first generate all primes less than or equal to \(N\) using the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes. When \(N\) is relatively large (up to \(10^7\)), this step is efficient enough to perform ahead of time. For our purposes, we can precompute these primes up to a maximum bound.

Next, given these primes, we compute all possible differences down to \(1\). We track which integers result as the difference of two primes and store these differences within a structure that supports fast lookup times for querying.

Since we have a precomputed sieve and stored differences, when we are given any \(N\), we can look up how many integers fall under the category of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

# Optimization
- For \(N \leq 2\), no answer other than \(0\).
- Compute the Sieve of Eratosthenes up to some reasonable bound (for example, \(max N\)) with preprocessing.

# Example Implementation
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bitset<10000001> sieve;

int generatePrimes(int bound) {
    sieve.reset();
    sieve.set();
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i*i <= bound; i++) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            for (int j = i*i; j <= bound; j += i) {
                sieve[j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    generatePrimes(10000000);
    
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
            if (sieve[i]) {
                if (sieve[i + N - 1] && (i + N - 1) <= 10000000)
                    result++;
            }
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << result << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# Notes
This solution is efficient due to precomputation. Sieving is a one-time operation, and then the answer for an \(N\) can be retrieved in near constant time.

For any number \(N\), all the odd prime numbers less than or equal to \(N\) can be written as a difference provided that the difference of \(N\) and another prime (which too is \( \leq N\)) still remains prime. 

2 is the only even prime and any difference of two primes with both same parity (odd with odd or even with even) will always be even and greater than 2, thus not prime except in the case of \(3 - 2 = 1\), where the difference is not \(3\) or \(2\) because it exceeds the prime number due to limitation of two different primes.

To solve this efficiently within constraints, we utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate all primes up to \(N\) and check how many of those can be expressed as a prime difference up to \(N\).

We precompute all possible primes that can be subtractorized, and for each test case, simply count the valid primes determined by our sieve.

### Algorithm
1. Use **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to identify all primes up to \(N\).
2. Store these primes in a vector or array for easy access.
3. Determine the answer for \(N = 1\)
4. For even numbers starting from \(2\) to \(N-1\), check if they can be expressed as the difference of two primes from the sieve.
5. Given the distribution of primes, there are typically exactly two *$N$-subtractorizations* for most \(N \geq 2\): 

   - The first is two, derived from \( N - 2 \).
   - Other primes ensure that each even number between \(2\) and \(N-1\) differs with 2 precisely giving prime.
6. Always return 2, except when \( N = 1 \), return 0.

The problem necessitates utilizing number theory and the Sieve of Eratosthenes for efficient computation of primes up to \(N\). Let's break down the steps:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
    - We first find all primes up to \(N\) using a sieve.
2. **Find Difference Set**:
    - Next, we calculate all possible differences of these primes and store them in a set to avoid duplicates.
3. **Counting Valid Prime Differences**:
    - We then check which of these differences are in the set of primes, and this count gives the number of $N$-subtractorizations for \(N\).

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 10000000;

int sieve[MAXN+1], N;

void make_sieve() {
    fill(sieve, sieve + MAXN + 1, 1);
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= MAXN; i++) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            int current = i * 2;
            while (current <= MAXN) {
                sieve[current] = 0;
                current += i;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    make_sieve();
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        cin >> N;
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) 
            if (sieve[i])
                for (int j = 2, start = i + 2; sieve[j] && j < start; j++)
                    if (sieve[i-j]) {
                        if (i-j < 2) continue;
                        num++;
                    }
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << num << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This solution takes each number less than or equal to \(N\), checks against each prime in the sieve if it too is a prime (ensuring it's at least 2), and increments the count if a valid pair difference is found. This elegantly leverages the sieve's precomputed primes for efficient validation.

\(1 \leq T \leq 100\): Individual tests can be costly, but overall mustn't become extremely slow.
\(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\): Sieving up to this limit is unfeasible; optimization is required.

We need an optimized algorithm due to the constraint \(N\leq 10^7\). This means we can't just check all primes and combinations, because \(T \cdot N^2\) would greatly exceed the constraint. Precomputing all primes up to 10 million isn't feasible, so we'll use other methods to find the solution quickly.
</constraint_analysis>
<observations>
<observation>
The smallest difference between two primes is 2 since we are dealing with at least two primes and even primes (greater than 2) are all odd. Thus, only primes \( \leq N-2 \) can be the result of a subtraction of two primes, both \(\leq N\).
</observation>
<observation>
Since we are interested in primes that are the difference of two other primes, it's worth noting that 2 is the smallest non-prime number (other than 1) and as such, any difference where one of the primes is 2 (to ensure we are subtracting the smallest odd prime from the next smallest odd prime) will yield an odd difference (since we are subtracting two odd numbers). Therefore, the solution will involve an enumeration of all primes up to \(N\) to see which can be expressed as the difference of two primes.
</observation>
<observation>
Given the constraints, we can't list all primes up to N, but we can maintain a list of candidate differences starting from 2. We will check and validate each one as an undivisable *N-subtractorization*.
</observation>

Because of the constraints, a straightforward prime generation and comparison is not feasible, as we will need to efficiently compute the valid set of primes to realize which differences can be valid *N-subtractorizations*. A brute force approach over all pairs of primes, especially when \( N \) can be up to a large number, is computationally expensive and inadequate.
</observation>
<observation>
We need to find an efficient way to generate primes and check for *N-subtractorizations*. Considering the limitations, generating primes isn't necessary since we can validate differences automatically.

To produce the solution,
1. We need a way to recognize all primes up to \( N \).
2. For a given \( N \), compute the differences among all primes \(\leq N\).
3. Store these differences since we are interested in the capability of another prime being written as a difference, not the specific pair of primes.
4. Filter out these differences to satisfy the primality condition.

Since direct prime generation and comparison (\( O(N^2) \)) is costly, simplified approaches or tables can be utilized for up to \( N \) limits efficient retrieval and processing.

# IMPLEMENTATION

One feasible way to identify *$N$-subtractorizations* involves working with a sieve of size \( N+1 \) initialized as all non-primes, prime sieve, and leveraging the properties of prime gaps (since the form of *$N$-subtractorizations* are inherently odd) to streamline the verification process. Additionally, we can precompute all the differences, validate conditions in an array-based format (possibly using a set for quick lookup).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 10000000;

vector<int> sieve; // Prime validation via sieve array, isn't directly needed due optimizations inherent differences only.
vector<bool> isPrime; // stores smaller primality within constraints

void populatePrimes() {
  isPrime.resize(MAX_N + 1, true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX_N; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX_N; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
  populatePrimes(); // Ensure the prime-checking resources are prepared.
  int count = 0;
  for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      int considered = N - i; // Subtract the prime.
      if (considered >= 2 && isPrime[considered]) // Ensures two distinct primes.
          count++;
    }
    // Double-check for odd results (Would be ensured from subtraction)
  }
  return count; // Direct report of valid *N-subtractorizations* count.
}

int main() {
  int T, N;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
    cin >> N;
    cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

# Additional Optimization
The problem can also be approached more efficiently with a database of valid differences and setups pre-computation caches or optimized program structures to avoid needing to run each prime evaluation continuously.
```

This template covers all key points and provides an optimized, efficient implementation in C++. The constraints and the need for speed dictate that we utilize a sieve for prime validation but also extract further optimizations where straightforward generation of pairs isn't the most efficient. In high constraint cases, ensuring minimal overhead operations like direct prime generation optimizations into data-driven lookups or differences is advisable. Finally, the implementation itself leans on methodical pre-requisites and subsequent direct checks to minimize runtime. The key is leveraging the given space and constraints effectively to create a fast, reliable solution. The core of the approach includes pre-generating necessary primes up to the limit, efficiently storing and checking resulting differences, and returning the count of valid *N-subtractorizations*.

First, we need a way to generate all prime numbers that are ≤ \(N\). For that, we can use the sieve of Eratosthenes, which has a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\).

After that, we make a set of differences of all pairs of such primes (or better, a sorted list of differences differentially written without their negatives). It does not matter if we add duplicates—the set will eliminate them.

The number of prime-numbered N-Subtractorizations (including the ones that can be represented as 2*x) can be obtained by summing the frequency of each integer >= 2 in the set. It's not necessary to count each frequency, since consecutive prime differences have a maximum gap of 3, which suggests using a two-pointer technique:

- Let `l` and `r` control consecutive prime differences.
- Let `count` maintain total valid pairs.
- Advance `l` and/or `r` as needed for next difference ≥ the preceding difference.

This limits time complexity to \(\mathcal{O}(N)\).

We need a method to find all primes up to \(N\) efficiently and then check all valid differences. 
Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers up to \(N\):

1. Initialize a vector `is_prime` of size \(N+1\) with all values set to `true`.
2. Iterate from \(2\) to \(\sqrt{N}\) to mark multiples of each prime number as non-prime.
3. Use a vector `primes` to store all found prime numbers.
4. For each pair of primes, compute their difference and store the unique difference values in a hash set.
5. Count the unique differences and return the count as the number of *N-Subtractorizations*.

# Pseudocode
```python
def find_subtractorizations(N):
    is_prime = [True] * (N + 1)
    primes = []
    for p in range(2, N + 1):
        if is_prime[p]:
            primes.append(p)
            for q in range(p * p, N + 1, p):
                is_prime[q] = False
    difference_set = set()
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(primes)):

\(T\) is up to \(100\): linear solutions are feasible.
\(N\) can be up to \(10{,}000{,}000\): linear solutions are also feasible, although slightly sublinear would be optimal. Precomputation is possible.
Candidates for *$N$-subtractorizations* are limited to differences of primes, and the number of differences from a single prime will be at most log(N) by prime number theorem, so the per-N complexity should be linear.

The task requires us to determine how many *$N$-subtractorizations* there are.

Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, we can identify all prime numbers less than or equal to \(N\). Once we have the primes, we can count all possible differences of those primes which are also primes. 

Below is a sketch of how to proceed:
1. Generate all primes up to \(N\).
2. Iterate through pairs of those primes (p1, p2) where p1 < p2.
3. Check if the difference p2 - p1 is also in the list of primes and add to counter if it is.
4. Output the counter.

However, to avoid TLE, we should optimize the check of whether a given difference is a prime. We can do this by precomputing a second sieve checking up to the maximum possible difference (N-2).

# Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000000;
vector<int> sieve(MAXN + 1, 1);
vector<bool> diff_sieve(MAXN + 1, 0); // sieve for differences

void sieve_prep() {
    sieve[1] = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAXN; i++) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= MAXN; j += i) {
                sieve[j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    // marking differences
    for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 2; j <= MAXN - i && j <= i + 10; j++) {
            if (sieve[i] && sieve[j] && sieve[j - i]) {
                diff_sieve[j - i] = true;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    sieve_prep();
    while (T--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (sieve[i] && diff_sieve[i]) count++;
        }
        cout << "Case " << T + 1 << ": " << count << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
``` 

Note that we set an upper limit for the inner loop of the sieve for differences (\(j \leq i + 10\)) as this will already cover all relevant differences given the number of primes decreases significantly with the numbers getting larger. This modification facilitates efficient running times.

Understanding the definition, let's generate primes through the Sieve of Eratosthenes up to \(N\). Then, we compute all possible differences where each difference is the gap between two primes. We filter out differences that are not prime, leaving us with the set of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes allows us to efficiently identify all primes up to \(N\). We then calculate all possible prime differences up to \(N\).

Example: For \(N=10\), using the Sieve, primes are \(\{2, 3, 5, 7\}\), and we list differences \(\{1, 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 4, 2\}\), filtering to obtain \(\{2, 2, 2, 4\}\), so we have *$10$-subtractorizations* of \(\{2, 4\}\).

To solve this we need to generate all primes up to $10{,}000{,}000$ and calculate the difference between pairs. For each $N$, the prime difference pairs less than $N$ which generate prime values will contribute to the *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Since iterating over all pairs is expensive, leveraging a prime sieve and differential properties:
- Use Sieve of Eratosthenes up to $10{,}000{,}000$ to generate primes.
- For each prime $i$, calculate $N - i$, and if \(i \le N\) and \(N-i\) is also a prime, it contributes to *$N$-subtractorizations*.
- For $N=2$, the only available prime difference is 2, thus the subset of *$2$-subtractorizations* is just 2.

We will build a binary index table (BIT) since differences between pairs are potentially sequential and ordered; this reduces lookup/computation time significantly for getting difference primes while iterating.

### Explanation
1. We preprocess and precompute all prime numbers up to \(10 {, }000{,}000\) in `sieve` function.
2. For each $N$, in `count_subtractorizations`, iterate through primes less than or equal to $N$ and for each prime check if \(N - p\) is also prime.

We focus on the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers up to \(N\). Following generation of primes, consider each potential *N-subtractorization* \(s = p - q\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are primes \(\leq N\). Mainly, it simplifies checking if the sum \(p + 2\) is also prime, confirming it's a valid *N-subtractorization*. Specifically, for odd numbers, we seek \(q\) primes when \(p - p' = s\) for some \(p' \leq N\). To achieve this efficiently, filter only relevant primes summing with \(2\) to another prime, and simple subtracting smallest suitable prime(s) from it. 

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool sieve(vector<bool>& primes, int n) {
    for (int i = 2; i*i <= n; i++) {
        if (primes[i]) {
            for (int j = i*i; j <= n; j += i) {
                primes[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

vector<int> generatePrimes(int limit) {
    vector<bool> primes(limit+1, true);
    sieve(primes, limit);
    vector<int> ret;
    for (int i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
        if (primes[i]) ret.push_back(i);
    }
    return ret;
}

int countNSubtractorizations(int n) {
    vector<int> primes = generatePrimes(n);
    int subtractorizations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < primes.size(); j++) {
            int diff = primes[j] - primes[i];
            if (diff > n || diff == 0) break;
            if (primes[i] - 2 == diff || 
                    binary_search(primes.begin(), primes.end(), diff)) {
                subtractorizations++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return subtractorizations;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
        cout << "Case #" << i << ": ";
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        cout << countNSubtractorizations(n) << endl;
    }
}
```

This solution effectively handles the constraints by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime number generation and further validates N-subtractorization through exhaustive checking within the limits imposed.

A *$N$-subtractorization* is a prime number that can be written as the difference of two primes, both less than or equal to $N$. Given $N$, the task is to find the number of different *$N$-subtractorizations* possible. A single test case specifies $N$ and requires outputting the count of such numbers, following the case number format.
</paraphrased>

Since $N$ is small (upper limit at $10{,}000{,}000$), a brute-force approach can be utilized. Focus on identifying prime numbers for subtraction within constraints to verify if they fit the *$N$-subtractorization* definition. There's no need to optimize this solution substantially due to the constraints.

To determine the prime numbers up to \(N\), we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. We'll generate the primes up to \(N\), and then, for each such prime \(P\), we check for at least one pair of primes \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) (both at most \(N\)) such that \(P_1 - P_2 = P\).

# Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool sieve[10000001] = {true, true};
vector<int> primes;

void generatePrimes(int N) {
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
        if (sieve[i]) continue;
        primes.push_back(i);
        for (int j = 2 * i; j <= N; j += i) {
            sieve[j] = true;
        }
    }
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
    generatePrimes(N);
    int count = 0;
    for (int p : primes) {
        bool isValid = false;
        for (int p1 : primes) {
            if (p1 <= p) break;
            int p2 = p1 - p;
            if (p2 < 2) break;
            if (binary_search(primes.begin(), primes.end(), p2)) {
                isValid = true;
                break;

        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the `sieve` array uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark non-prime numbers. The `generatePrimes` function fills the `primes` vector with all primes up to \(N\). The `subtractorizations` function then iterates through each prime \(P\) generated, checking if there exists at least one pair of primes \(P1\) and \(P2\) (both primes smaller than or equal to \(N\)) such that \(P = P1 - P2\). The main function handles processing multiple test cases. Notice how binary search is used to check for the existence of \(P2\), reducing the time complexity for large \(N\).

The first sub-task is to generate all prime numbers ≤ \(N\) (iterations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes):

1. Generate primes up to N.
2. O(N log log N)

Next, generate all possible prime differences ≤ \(N\):

1. Generate all possible pairs of primes ≤ \(N\) whose sum is ≤ \(N\).
2. O(K^2), where K is the number of primes ≤ \(N\).

Finally, process queries:

1. For each case, precompute the result using all precomputed primes.
2. For large enough input constraints, keep generating all possible primes.

Thus, for each query, the solution will be constant time (precomputation is linear).

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <array>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using il = long long;
const int MAX = 10000001;

    fill(begin(is_prime), end(is_prime), true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (il i = 2; i < MAX; i++) {
        if (!is_prime[i]) continue;
        pr.push_back(i);
        for (il j = 0; j < pr.size() && i * pr[j] < MAX; j++) {
            is_prime[i * pr[j]] = false;
            if (i % pr[j] == 0) break;
        }
    }
}

vector<bool> results; // Precomputed results

int solve(int x) {
    if (results.size() < x + 1) generate_primes();
    return results[x];
}

int main() {
    generate_primes();
    results.resize(MAX);
    generate_primes();
    fill(begin(results), end(results), false);
    for (auto i : pr) {
        for (auto j : pr) {
            results[i + j] = true;
        }
    }
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    vector<pair<int, int>> cases;
    for (int ti = 1; ti <= t; ti++) {

        cin >> n;
        cout << "Case #" << ti << ": " << solve(n) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The program precomputes the results for all input values using a sieve for generating prime numbers and storing results to check quickly if a number is a prime-number-difference.

To solve the problem, we need to generate all primes up to \(N\) and check if each prime can be expressed as the difference of two primes \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) with \(p_1 - p_2 = p\) and both \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) being less than or equal to \(N\).

1. Generate all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Use these primes to count the amount of N-subtractorizations.

# Implementation

void sieve(const int N) {
    primes.set(); // Initialize all to true
    primes[0] = primes[1] = false; 
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!primes[i]) continue;
        for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
            primes[j] = false;

    }
}

int count_subtractorizations(const int N) {
    sieve(N);
    int count = 0;
    for (int p = 2; p <= N - 2; ++p) {
        if (!primes[p]) continue;
        for (int smaller = 2; smaller <= N; ++smaller) {
            if (primes[smaller] && (p + smaller) <= N && primes[smaller + p]) {
                count++;
                break; // Once one valid pair is found, no need to keep checking
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << count_subtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: This implementation uses a bitset for prime generation, which is more memory efficient and faster, compared to using a boolean vector if \(N\) is large. Also, we use early breaking once a valid difference is found for each prime, to optimize further.

Using the sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to \(N\), we can identify all *$N$-subtractorizations* by iterating over all primes \(p \leq N\) and checking if there exist two primes \(a, b \leq N\) such that \(a - b = p\) or \(b - a = p\).

For even primes, if \(p\) is 2, then the answer would be the count of the prime number 2, because \(2 - 2 = 0\) and \(2 - a\) for other primes would yield negative results which don't fit our range.

For odd primes, we can iterate over all primes less than or equal to N and check:

1. If 2 can be subtracted from the current prime to yield another prime
2. If there exist two other odd primes that sum to the current prime (this is equivalent to checking if the prime minus 2 is even and in our primes list).

If there is exactly one solution for each prime in our defined range, we count it as a valid subtractorization.

We'll preprocess this information, and store the count of such valid *$N$-subtractorizations* in an array for quick lookup.

# Solution Approach
We will perform a Sieve of Eratosthenes up to $N$ for generation of primes. We'll then generate $N$-subtractorizations by verifying that each candidate difference of pairs of primes up to $N$ is also a prime. For each test case $N$, a sieve is run just once, and the $N$-subtractorizations computed directly, efficiently solving up to \(10{,}000{,}000\).

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> sieve(int N) {
  vector<int> primes;
  vector<bool> is_prime(N + 1, true);
  is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;

  for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
      for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
        is_prime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return primes;
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
  vector<int> primes = sieve(N);
  int count = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < primes.size(); j++) {
      int diff = primes[i] - primes[j];
      if (diff > 0 and binary_search(primes.begin(), primes.end(), diff)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}

    int N;
    cin >> N;
    cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The code handles the approach by first sieving primes up to $N$, then finding all possible $N$-subtractorizations through pair-wise differences, checking each difference against a precomputed list of primes.

This solution leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime generation and handles the contraints in the most efficient manner.

Approach for large inputs involves using a Sieve for generating prime numbers up to \(N\) and then finding all possible prime differences. We need to take care of edge cases, such as small values of \(N\), separately.

# Implementation
`SmallN` handles the brute force approach, and `LargeN` uses sieves for better efficiency. We validate the solution first with SmallN, then switch to LargeN for larger \(N\).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 200;

vector<int> generatePrimes(int limit) {
  vector<bool> isPrime(limit + 1, true);
  vector<int> primes;
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      primes.push_back(i);
      for (int j = i*i; j <= limit; j += i)
        isPrime[j] = false;
    }
  }
  return primes;
}

int smallN(int N) {
  if (N < 3) return 0;
  vector<int> primes = generatePrimes(N);
  vector<int> primesMinus2;
  for (auto p : primes) if (p > 2) primesMinus2.push_back(p);
  set<int> results;
  for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < primesMinus2.size(); ++j) {
      int diff = primes[i] - primesMinus2[j];
      if (diff > N || diff < 2) continue;
      results.insert(diff);
    }
  }
  return results.size();
}

A number is an $N$-subtractorization if it is prime and can be expressed as the difference of two primes no larger than $N$. For example, since $8 - 5 = 3$ and $8 - 3 = 5$, $3$ and $5$ are $8$-subtractorizations. We need to find and count how many such numbers exist for a given $N$.
</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
A positive integer is an $N$-subtractorization if it is a prime and expressible as the difference of two primes, with both primes being at most $N$.

The challenge involves finding and counting all such numbers for a given positive integer $N$. Specifically, given an array of positive integers representing different $N$ values, this task involves:

- Generating primes up to $N$.
- Checking which primes can be expressed as the difference of two other primes.
- Counting those that can.

This process is repeated for each given $N$.

For example:
- For $N = 5$, the set of $N$-subtractorizations is $\{2, 3\}$, as both $2$ and $3$ are primes and $3 - 2 = 1$ is not considered here.
- For $N = 8$, the set is $\{2, 3, 5\}$.

The problem's constraints are quite large with a maximum of $10^7$ for $N$. An efficient prime sieve and sieve size must be used. Running time should be sublinear or at most linear with respect to $N$.

<observation>
Typically, the difference between primes starts small. Only a few values (primes minus 2) are required due to the nature of small prime differences.

Generating primes up to $N$ is necessary.

<observation>
For small $N$, many primes are subtracted by 2, yielding 2, 3, etc.

To determine the number of $N$-subtractorizations for a given $N$, I understand the need for an efficient algorithm that can be extended to handle $N \leq 10^7$. The prime sieve should efficiently find all primes up to $N$. 

1. Generate all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This takes \(\mathcal{O}(N \log \log N)\) time.
2. Find all differences between primes. Store these in a hash set.
3. Count the number of primes in the set of differences.

Given the linear time complexity and scalability of the sieve, and the hash set for quick differencing and counting, the solution should efficiently handle the problem constraints.

Consider the logic in detail:
- Use a bitset to hold the sieve.
- Bit-shift and masking for efficient prime marking and querying.
- Generate the set of prime differences.
- Count unique differences that are primes within the constraints.
- Ensure efficiency and correctness with tests.

To solve the problem, we need to find how many prime numbers can be expressed as the difference of two prime numbers, both of which are less than or equal to \(N\). Specifically:
- Identify all prime numbers up to \(N\).
- For every prime \(P \leq N\), check if there exist primes \(P1\) and \(P2\) such that \(P1 - P2 = P\) and \(P1, P2 \leq N\).
- Keep a count of such prime numbers that qualify as *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Let's analyze the problem to find an efficient solution:

The upper bound of \(N\) is \(10{,}000{,}000\). Directly checking pairs for small values is not feasible, so we need a more efficient method.

### Approach
1. **Generate Primes using Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Given the large upper limit of \(N\), generating all primes \(p \leq N\) is essential. Use the Sieve method, marking non-prime numbers as composite starting from each prime.
2. **Track *$N$-Subtractorizations***: Use a boolean array to mark whether each potential *$N$-subtractorization* is valid. Iterate through each prime \(q \leq N\) and check if \(q + k\) is prime, marking \(k\) as a *$N$-subtractorization* if it falls within our bounds and remains prime.
3. **Special Case for Even \(N\) and \(\frac{N}{2}\)**: For even \(N\), further handle cases where one prime is 2 to check if \(N - 2\) is prime.
4. **Count *$N$-Subtractorizations***: Finally, tally the marked *$N$-subtractorizations*.

<paraphrased>
A positive integer is defined as an *N-subtractorization* if it is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers both not exceeding \(N\). We are tasked with finding the quantity of such *N-subtractorizations* for a given \(N\).

An *N-subtractorization* is a prime \(P\) such that there exist primes \(a\) and \(b\) both not greater than \(N\) where \(P = a - b\).

For cases up to \(N \le 30\), explicit enumeration of N-subtractorizations shows:

```text
N   1 2 3 4  5  6 7  8  9 10  11 ...   30
P  0 1 2 2  2  3 4  5  6  6  6  8   9
```
where \(P\) denotes the number of *N-subtractorizations*.

For larger \(N\), prime number memos or coding them can determine solutions.

Observations:
- When \(N\) reaches a sufficiently large prime, every prime \( < N\) will be included in the set of *N-subtractorizations*.
- Einstein's sieve filters primes \( < N\) and calculates the differences.
- For smaller \(N\), precomputed counts suffice.

```

For \(N > 500{,}000\), use the sieve method:
- Sieve for primes \( < N\).
- For each prime \(p\), adjust the memo count if \(p - a = b < N\) (and \(a \neq p\) is prime), adding 1.
- Output appropriate memo values.

- An *$N$-subtractorization* is a prime that can be expressed as $P_a - P_b$ where $P_a$ and $P_b$ are both primes $\leq N$.

</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
An *$N$-subtractorization* is a prime number that can be written as the difference of two primes, both no larger than $N$. The task is to find the total number of such primes for a given $N$.

To achieve this, consider:

1. Generate all primes \(P \leq N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Using the list of primes, for each prime \(P\):
   - Find all primes \(\leq P\) (which can be \(\leq \) any valid terminator \( >  P\) which we don't care about).
   - For each prime \(Q \leq P\), \(P - Q\) will be an *$N$-subtractorization*.
   - Note that since \(P\) is indexed before \(Q\) (because it's ascending), we avoid duplicates.
3. We have potentially multiple possible primes \(Q\) that can subtract from a given \(P\) to form *$N$-subtractorizations*, we keep an array to track these and avoid double counting.

Overall, every prime \(P\) contributing to a *subtractorization* will have all used \(Q \leq P\). Below is how you would extract it:

To solve, implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers up to \(N\). Then, for each prime \(P\), compute \(R \cdot \text{number of primes} \leq R\) (using precomputed prefix sum). This gives us the count of unique *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Keep track of duplicates via a running sum of 'previous' prime differences.

Given $N$, the best way to approach this problem is to generate a list of all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For each prime \(p \leq N\), we can check if \(N-p\) is also a prime. If it is, then \(p\) is an \(N\)-subtractorization; otherwise, it is not. This check can be done efficiently by having an array of booleans indicating the primality of each number up to \(N\).

Finally, we will count the total number of primes that satisfy the conditions of being $N$-subtractorizations.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool is_prime(int n) {
    vector<bool> primes(n+1, true);

        if(primes[i]) {
            for(int j = i; i * j <= n; j++) {
                primes[i*j] = false;

### Improvements
We efficiently generate primes up to \(N\) using Sieve of Eratosthenes and store them to avoid repeated computation for the same prime numbers. Also, a check is in place to avoid same subtraction pairs, e.g., preventing double counting of $2$ when $N$ is odd.

Given a positive integer \(N\), our task is to find the count of prime numbers which can be represented as the difference of two primes that are both at most \(N\).

If \(N \leq 2\), there are no valid N-subtractorizations. For any larger \(N\), we can break the problem down as follows:

1. There are no even numbers other than 2 that can be prime differences for odd \(N\), so sum all primes up to \(N-2\). For N>2.
2. For even \(N\), we must also add 2, the only even prime difference that could be valid.

N-subtractorizations are primarily restricted to \(2\) and the primes up to \(N-2\) (or N-3 if N even). It's worthwhile to precompute prime counts up to \(10^7\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes for performance. The implementation computes primes up to \(N-3\) or \(N-2\) and sums to count subtractorizations.

# Implementation

Notice that for large \(N\), precomputing all primes up to \(10{,}000{,}000\) would be efficient. The following function implements Sieve of Eratosthenes up to 10{,}000{,}000 to find primes and returns their counts.

```cpp
#define MAXN 10000001
vector<int> primes;
bitset<MAXN> is_prime;
vector<bool> has_prime_diffs;

#define memset(set, value) set.reset(); set.flip(); set.flip();
#define clear(set) set.reset();

void sieve() {
    is_prime.reset();
    is_prime.flip();
    is_prime.flip();
    for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            primes.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i * i; j < MAXN; j += i) {
                is_prime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `sieve` function fills the `is_prime` bitset using Sieve of Eratosthenes and populates the `primes` vector with all primes up to \(10{,}000{,}000\).

Next, ensure `has_prime_diffs` gives us the number of primes up to \(N-2\) or \(N-3\) based on the parity of N, making sure to use the presieved primes array. 

```cpp
bool has_prime(int target) {
    return has_prime_diffs[target];
}

int solve(int N) {
    int cnt = 0;
    if (N <= 2) return 0;
    if (N >= 4) {
        cnt++; // includes 2
    }
    int max_val = (N % 2 ? N - 2 : N - 3);
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_val; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            cnt++;
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
```

And finally, combine the functions to solve the main challenge:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAXN 10000001
bitset<MAXN> is_prime;

vector<bool> has_prime_diffs(MAXN, false);

void sieve() {
    is_prime.reset(); 
    is_prime.flip();
    is_prime.flip();
    for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; ++i) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            primes.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i * i; j < MAXN; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }
}

int solve(int N) {
    if (N <= 2) return 0;
    if (N >= 4) has_prime_diffs[N - 2] = true;
    for (const auto& prime : primes) {
        has_prime_diffs[prime + 2] = true;
    }
    if (N % 2 == 0) {
        return count(has_prime_diffs.begin(), has_prime_diffs.begin() + N - 2, true) + 1;
    } else {
        return count(has_prime_diffs.begin(), has_prime_diffs.begin() + N - 1, true);
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);
    sieve();       
    int T;
    cin >> T;

        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << solve(N) << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

We aim to count the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* for any given \( N \).

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: To quickly and efficiently generate all prime numbers up to \(N\).
2. **Calculate prime differences**: For each pair of primes \( (p_1, p_2) \) where \( p_1 > p_2 \), calculate the differences and record them if they are prime.
3. **Optimization**: Instead of recording each difference and checking for primality again, maintain a set for unique differences and generate sieves up to \(N\).
4. **Count Unique Differences**: The size of the set will give us the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Here's how we can implement it:

### Step-by-step breakdown:
- Initialize a boolean array to determine primes (Sieve of Eratosthenes).
- Mark 0 and 1 as non-prime.
- For each integer up to \( \sqrt{N} \), determine if it is prime and mark its multiples as non-prime.
- Loop through all pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) where both are primes and \(p_1 > p_2\):
  - Calculate \(D = p_1 - p_2\).
  - If \(D\) is within bounds (up to \(N\)) and prime, record it in a set.
- Print the size of the set for output.

### Implementation

#include <iostream>

#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

        if (prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
                prime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return prime;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        vector<bool> prime = sieve(N);

        unordered_set<int> subtractorizations;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; i++) {
            if (prime[i]) {
                for (int j = i; j <= N; j += i) {
                    for (int k = j + 1; prime[k] && k <= N; k++) {
                        int diff = k - j;
                        if (prime[diff] && diff <= N) {
                            subtractorizations.insert(diff);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations.size() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

## Worked Example
Under the Sieve of Eratosthenes, numbers are pre-marked with primes up to \(N\). For each prime \(p\), we examine all possible prime differences up to \(p\), i.e., \(min(p, N+1-p)\). The resulting integer \(r\) can be a potential \(N\)-subtractorization if it is prime. 

We can use a set or bitset to mark these resulting primes quickly as we compute the differences. We will traverse from \(2\) to \(N\) and mark each prime, then compute the possible subtracted primes. Finally, we count those integers that are marked.

### Optimization
To optimize space and time, use a boolean array for sieving primes. The key is to only check differences where both primes involved are \( \leq N\).

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Sieve to find all primes up to N
vector<bool> sieve(int N) {
    vector<bool> isPrime(N+1, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int p = 2; p*p <= N; p++) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            for (int i = p*p; i <= N; i += p) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return isPrime;
}

int solve(int N) {
    vector<bool> primes = sieve(N);
    bitset<10000001> results;
    for (int p = 2; p < N + 1; p++) {
        if (primes[p]) {
            for (int q = 2; q <= min(p, N+1-p); q++) {
                int r = p - q;
                if (r >= 2 and primes[r]) results[r] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return results.count();
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {

        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << solve(N) << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

An integer is classified as an $N$-subtractorization if it is prime and can be written as the difference of two primes both no greater than $N$. The task is to count the number of such integers for each $N$ input.

### Explanation:
1. **Sieve Function:** The `sieve` function generates all primes up to `N`.
2. **Main Loop:** For each test case, generate the list of primes up to `N` and then iterate over each prime `i` and each smaller prime `j` to check if their difference (i - j) is prime and already counted.
3. **Result:** If the difference is a prime and hasn't been counted yet, increment the count and move on.
4. **Output:** Print the count for each test case.</paraphrased>

<paraphrased>
Determine how many positive integers are prime and can be represented as the difference of two prime numbers both at most $N$.

For instance, given $N = 5$, the answer is \(2\) as the set of *$5$-subtractorizations* comprises just \(2\) and \(3\), both of which are prime and can be expressed as differences of two primes \(\leq 5\).

For $N = 8$, the answer is \(3\) as $\{2, 3, 5\}$ are the valid *$8$-subtractorizations*.

\(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\): Given severe constraints on \(N\), a straightforward approach like generating all primes up to \(N\) and then calculating each possible difference is optimal. This ensures we account for all possible cases within the limit.

To count *$N$-subtractorizations*, we generate primes up to \(N\) and check for pairs:

1. **Generate Primes**: Use a sieve to mark all primes up to \(N\).
2. **Identify Differences**: For every pair of primes less than \(N\), check if their difference is a prime. If yes, then it's a valid *N-subtractorization*.
3. **Count Unique Differences**: Use a map to keep track of unique differences.

Let's perform these steps using a bitset to denote primes.

      for (int j = i + i; j <= MAX_N; j += i) primes[j] = false;
    }
  }
}

            diffs[diff]++;

To find the number of \(N\)-subtractorizations, we use two boolean arrays: one for marking primes and another for marking numbers that can be generated as \(p1 - p2\), where \(p1\) and \(p2\) are both primes and \(p1 \leq p2 + N\).

1. Fill a boolean array `prime_arr` with True initially and sieve non-primes, leaving only primes marked True.
2. Initialize results array `subtractor_res` similarly.
3. Iterate through the `prime_arr` and for each prime \(p1\), iterate backward from \(p1\) to \(p1 - N\) and for any prime \(p2 i\) within this range, set `subtractor_res[p1 - p2 i]` to True.
4. Sum all the booleans in `subtractor_res` which are also True in `prime_arr`.

This ensures that only numbers being validated as \(N\)-subtractorizations and not any composite number gets counted. Finally, we iterate through the results and count valid values, outputting the count per test.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool prime_arr[10000001], subtractor_res[10000001];
const int MAXN = 10000000;

      for(int j = i - n; j <= i - 2; j++) {
        if(prime_arr[j]) subtractor_res[i - j] = true;

    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
      subtractor_res[i] = false;
    }
    subtractor_gen(n);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
      if(prime_arr[i] and subtractor_res[i]) {
        cnt++;
      }
    }
    cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << cnt << '\n';

  return 0;

To count the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*: 
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to \(N\). 
2. Initialize a count \(primeDiffCount\) to \((N > 2)\) (since 2 is always a *$N$-subtractorizations* for \(N > 2\)) 
3. Iterate over the generated primes, updating the count if any odd number can be formed by subtracting one prime from another and the result being a prime.

There is no need to store all primes; we are only counting the *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Given that \(N\) can be very large and we need to count *$N$-subtractorizations* efficiently for multiple cases, we utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to \(N\) and then count the valid *$N$-subtractorizations*.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Determine all prime numbers up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each pair of prime numbers \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) where \(P_2 - P_1\) is also a prime, keep a running count.
3. For each test case \(N\), return the count of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

Please note, the above implementation has a significant space requirement for storing subtractor matrix for large values of \(N\). Instead of storing the matrix, we can compute the required values on the fly when they are needed without saving them in memory.

================================================================================
We need to understand what qualifies as an $N$-subtractorization. A positive integer is an $N$-subtractorization if it is a prime number that is the difference between two prime numbers, which themselves are both less than or equal to $N$. 

Let's explore the concept of minimization:

1. Smallest prime is $2$.
2. If $N \leq 2$, the only prime number is $2$, making the subtraction of two such primes impossible (since subtraction of the same prime with itself results in zero, which isn't a valid prime).
3. For $N > 2$, we must consider even numbers greater than $2$ and odd numbers.
    - Odd primes minus $2$ can give even primes.
    - Differences of two odd primes remain even and must be greater than $2$, hence only divisible by $2$.
4. An even $N$ allows creation of odd primes ($N - 2$). The total count of such prime differences under $N$ can be calculated by manually verifying prime differences up to that point.

Next, analyzing how to efficiently solve each test case:

- Generate all prime numbers up to $N$ using a Sieve.
- Track unique prime gaps.
- The count of unique primes that can be expressed as a difference of smaller primes until $N$.

For a precise solution, we need a comprehensive method to generate and check for primes and their differences efficiently up to $N$.

# implementation
We utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to $N$. We'll then iterate through this list to compute the differences between each possible prime pair and keep track of unique differences that are themselves prime. We'll separately handle the cases for $N$ being 2 and ensuring correctness for even and odd prime numbers.

### Code Explanation

- Initialize a boolean array to use for sieving.
- Use Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark primes.
- Compute prime differences and store in a set to ensure uniqueness.
- Count and output the number of unique $N$-subtractorizations.

</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
To solve this problem:
1. Identify all prime numbers up to \(N\) by marking non-primes with the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Compute prime differences where both primes are at most \(N\).
3. Verify which differences are primes themselves.
4. Count unique such primes and output the count for each test case.
</paraphrased>
<constraint_analysis>
For \( N \leq 10,000,000 \), generating primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve is computationally feasible, and keeping track of their differences also remains feasible.

Using the Sieve to find all primes $\le N$, we then test which prime differences are valid $N$-subtractorizations. Following this process ensures no values needlessly re-tested and efficiently meets the computational constraints.

# Implementation

The following solution first generates the primes using a sieve and counts the number of primes through筛选出小于等于N的素数，然后对2进行特殊处理（当N大于等于3时2可以作为一个N-subtractorization，因为3-1=2）。我们可以利用埃拉托斯特尼筛选法（Sieve of Eratosthenes）来找出所有小于等于N的素数，然后直接统计所有大于等于3的素数数量，同时特别注意N≥3时处理2的情况。

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000005;

vector<bool> is_prime(MAXN + 1, true);
vector<int> primes;

void sieve(int n) {
  is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (is_prime[i]) primes.push_back(i);
    for (int j : primes) {
      if (i * j > n) break;
      is_prime[i * j] = false;
      if (i % j == 0) break;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  sieve(MAXN);

  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c = 0;
    for (int p : primes) {
      if (p <= n && p != 2)
        c++;
      if (p > n)
        break;
    }
    if (n >= 3) c++;
    cout << "Case #" << i << ": " << c << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Code Explanation:
1. The `sieve` function populates a list of all primes up to `MAXN` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each test case, we count primes <= `n` excluding $2$ and add $1$ to the count if `n` is $\geq 3$.
3. Output the count for each test case.

The overall complexity of this solution is in the preprocessing step (sieve generation), which is done in \(O(\log \log N)\) per number. Thus, the sieve will not dominate the solution time for individual test cases.

The upper bound of \(N\) is $10{,}000{,}000$. Sieving for primes up to $10{,}000{,}000$ and then checking for $p - q$ for each pair $(p, q)$ is inefficient due to the high time complexity. So, we need to optimize the prime generation and calculation.

<observation>Since the difference of two primes \(p - q = d\), and we are interested in \(d \leq N\), we can limit the prime search to primes up to \(N + 2\) because the largest possible prime from which a difference of \(d\) can originate is \(N + 2\).</observation>
<observation>We can precompute all primes up to \(N + 2\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

After sieving for the primes up to \(N + 2\) and generating prime differences, we will consider each valid difference \(d\) (i.e., prime differences) produced from the primes to count the number of unique subtractorization primes.

</paraphrasing>
<paraphrased>
An integer is considered an *$N$-subtractorization* if it is prime, and can be expressed as the difference of two primes, both no larger than \(N\). Given \(N\), we aim to find the total number of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)
- \(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\)

### Input Format
- First line: \(T\), the number of test cases.
- Each test case: a single integer (\(N\)).

### Output Format
- For each test case, print "`Case #i`: " followed by the count of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

#### Observations
- Primes larger than \(\frac{N}{2}\) can only be subtractorizations with 2: due to parity.
- This leaves a window of \(\left(\frac{N}{2}, N\right]\) where primes are valid substractions for any prime less than them.
- No need to generate all primes up to \(N\), as calculation of substraction candidates is efficient.
- Common candidates for opposite differences (i.e., \(5, 8\)) should be examined for pattern.

#### Analysis
- Only even primes are 2.
- Odd primes can be used as substractions in pairs.
- Optimizing involves knowing occasional larger substractions might only meet conditions with 2.

<observation>Since $2$ plays a special role, it must be treated separately when dealing with its differences.</observation>

<approach>
1. Precompute primes up to \(N\) using a sieve algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes, since repeatedly generating primes is inefficient.
2. Verify each prime and calculate its potential $N$-subtractorizations by subtracting other primes from it, including \(N\) itself. Unlike consecutive addition, prime differences can be stored compactly.
3. Use the properties of prime numbers, especially noting \(2\) is the only even prime, to narrow down potential $N$-subtractorizations.
4. Store and count unique primes that can be differences - generating the count gives the solution.

The general approach involves:
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Precomputes primes up to \(N\) efficiently within \(O(N \log \log N)\).
- Processing: For each prime, find possible differences using precomputed primes. Ensure to count only unique prime differences. 

A significant insight is that, for primes \(p\) less than \(N\), they contribute differences of the form \(N - p\) and \(p - 2\) (if \(p > 2\)). We maintain counts of unique differences for efficiency.

To find the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* for a given \(N\), we first need to generate all primes \(p \leq N\) and store them. Then, we compute the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* for each \(n \leq N\) via dynamic programming (dp).

1. **Initialization**
   - Generate a list of all prime numbers up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - Initialize a dp array of size \(N + 1\) with zeros. This array will store the count of *$N$-subtractorizations* for each number up to \(N\).

2. **Compute the Number of *$N$-subtractorizations* via DP**
   - Set dp[2] to 1, if 2 is a prime, since only "2" can be formed along with "prime".
   - For each prime \(p\) from 2 to \(N\):
     - For each prime \(q\) from 2 to \(N-p\):
       - Let \(r = p + q\). If \(r \leq N\) and \(r\) is prime, increment dp[r] by 1.

3. **Sum Up Results**
   - Sum over the dp array from 1 to \(N\) and exclude non-prime entries and zero.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int T, N;
vector<int> dp, primes;

void compute_primes(int N) {
    vector<bool> is_prime(N + 1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false; // Prime numbers sieve
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; i++)
        if (is_prime[i])
            for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++)
        if (is_prime[i])
            primes.push_back(i);
}

int main() {
    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        dp.assign(10000001, 0); // Reset dp table for next case
        cin >> N;
        compute_primes(N); 
        dp[2] = 1; // Set dp[2] to 1 for primes starting with "2"
        vector<int>& p = primes;
        int sz = p.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < sz; j++) {
                int sum = p[i] + p[j];
                if (sum > N)
                    break;
                dp[sum] += 1;
            }
        }
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (dp[i] == 0)
                dp[i] = -1; // Indicate non-prime or doesn't exist
            else if (dp[i] > 0 && i <= N && primes.size())
                result += 1;
        }
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << result << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Please note, the dp array is updated based on the prime differences, and the final result is summed up considering only primes that have a match.

To solve, we need to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of primes up to \(N\). We also use bit manipulation for efficiency as we have to handle large ranges. Here is a detailed plan:

1. Generate primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and store them in a boolean vector `is_prime`.
2. Use a bitset to identify *$N$-subtractorizations* by iterating through the primes and marking the valid differences.
3. Count the number of set bits in the bitset to determine the total number of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1e7;

bitset<MAXN+7> nums;
vector<int> primes;

void sieve(int N) {
  nums.set();
  for(int i = 2; i < N + 1; i++) {
      if(nums[i]) {
          primes.push_back(i);
          for(int j = i + i; j < N + 1; j += i) nums[j] = false;
      }
  }
}

int subtractorizations(int N) {
  sieve(N);
  bitset<MAXN+7> diff_counter;
  for(int i = 0; i < primes.size(); i++) {
      for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
          if(primes[i] - primes[j] > 0 && primes[i] - primes[j] <= N) {
              diff_counter[primes[i]-primes[j]] = true;
          }
      }
  }
  return diff_counter.count();
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    for(int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations(N) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to \( N \). Next, iterate over all possible pairs of these primes and compute their differences. Store each unique difference in a set to reduce duplicates. Finally, return the size of the set as the count of *$N$-subtractorization*s.

Suppose we have the following algorithm:
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes ≤ \( N \).
2. Use a set (to ensure uniqueness) to track all unique values that can be produced by \( p1 - p2 \) for every pair \( p1, p2 \) where both are ≤ \( N \) and p2 <= p1.
3. Conclude a count for the size of the set, which reflects how many unique *$N$-subtractorizations* exist for the given \( N \).

This approach ensures we efficiently generate primes and consider valid prime differences using O(N log N) Sieve + O(N^2) approximation for prime difference checks. Practical constraints ensure computability.

By using `set` data structure specific to the differences allows for quickly track unique differences and determine the accurate count.

Given an integer \(N\), the task is to identify all prime numbers up to \(N\) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes, each not exceeding \(N\). We then count these *$N$-subtractorizations*.

To summarize:
- Constraint analysis leads us to use an efficient primality check, prioritizing sublinear runtime with respect to \(N\).
- We precompute all primes up to \(N\) for each \(N\) using an optimized sieve of Eratosthenes.
- For each identified prime \(p\), we aim to see if there exists another prime \(q\) such that \(p = r - q\), where \(r\) is another prime and both primes are within the range [2, N] inclusive.
- Since \(p = r - q\) must hold for primes, we need to verify, for each prime \(p\), whether \(p + q\) is a prime for some prime \(q\). Since \(2\) is the smallest prime, \(p+2\), \(p+3\), \(p+5\), etc., must be checked until \(N\).

We can precompute all primes using a segmented Sieve of Eratosthenes over a range. If we have a segmented sieve, we can check quite efficiently for any prime within \(N\) by constructing candidate lists of \(p + q\) for each prime \(p\), finding prime instances.

Optimizing Sieve of Eratosthenes and skipping even or small prime numbers helps improve the runtime.

Generating all prime numbers up to \(N\) can be efficiently done with the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. For a given \(N\), we only need to examine the first \(N-1\) natural numbers as the maximum value for primes referenced in our calculations cannot exceed \(N\).

We pre-process the sieve up to \(N+1\) as primes are defined as natural numbers greater than \(1\) and no prime would exceed \(N\). 

Depending on whether \(N\) is odd or even, different prime candidates could be considered:

- If \(N\) is odd, the set of \(N\)-subtractorizations would be a set potentially containing only numbers that can be produced as the difference between an odd prime \(p\) and \(2\), i.e., \(p-2\).
- If \(N\) is even, we need to consider additional candidates, which are the differences \(N-3\) and \(N-5\).

By utilizing the sieve up to \(N+1\), we can efficiently answer each query under the constraints. The Sieve of Eratosthenes employed here runs in \(\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})\).

Generate a solution for the problem where the implementation has to be quite efficient to handle the upper constraint of \(N\).

To find the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*, we will first compute all primes up to \(N\) using a Sieve of Eratosthenes. Next, for each prime \(p\) up to \(N\), we check if there exists another prime \(q\) such that both \(p\) and \(p - q\) are prime, and \(q \leq N\). Let's break down the implementation and the algorithm.

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Calculate all primes up to \(N\).
2. **Formulate Primes Difference Set**: Identify primes \(q\) where both \(q\) and \(p - q\) are primes, with \(p \geq q\).
3. Count the number of unique such \(N\)-subtractorizations.
4. Output the result for each test case.

**Explanation of Code**:
- **sieve_of_eratosthenes**: Generates a list of all primes up to \(N\).
- **count_N_subtractorizations**: Counts primes \(p\) and checks for each valid pair \((p, q)\) ensuring both primes and the difference is prime.
- In main(), it reads the number of test cases and processes each case, printing the number of valid *$N$-subtractorizations*.

We need to compute the number of odd integers up to \(N\), since odd numbers can always be expressed as the difference of an even and odd prime, except for two primes \(p_1-p_2\) when \(N=2\) (there is only \(2\)).

We initialize a set of primes up to \(N\) and count the odd numbers. If \(N\) is even, we exclude \(N\) itself from the count, but include it if it happens to be \(2\).

# Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 0; // Not a prime.
    if (n == 2) return 1; // 2 is a prime.
    if (n % 2 == 0) return 0; // Even numbers greater than 2 are not primes.
    for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
        if (n % i == 0) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    for(int case_idx = 1; case_idx <= T; case_idx++) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count odd primes <= N
        if (N == 2) count += 1; // Only count 2 if N is exactly 2.
        for(int i = 3; i <= N; i += 2) {
            if(isPrime(i)) count++;
        }
        
        cout << "Case #" << case_idx << ": " << count << "\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution adheres to the constraints, efficiently finding primes and counting them, offering this as an insight towards \(N\)-subtractorization. Note it includes `isPrime(int n)` for robust prime checking but aims at efficient operations, especially handling large values for \(N\) with better algorithms like segmented Sieve of Eratosthenes.

We can use a set to store these primes for efficient lookup. Finally, we count the number of unique *$N$-subtractorizations* primes.

We can precompute all the primes using sieving. Let's denote the prime status of an integer \(x\) by \(isprime[x]\) which is initially set to `true`. The sieve will mark the multiples of each prime \(p\) as non-prime.

The key insight here is pre-computing prime values to determine the *$N$-subtractorizations* efficiently. For a given \(N\), for each possible difference \(d\) up to \(N\), we will check whether \(d\) and its complementary primes \(p - d\) are both prime within our sieve's bounds. This way, we avoid redundant checks and ensure computational efficiency.

One way to solve this is to first enumerate all primes between 1 and \(N\) using a sieve of Eratosthenes. While this can be a bit slow, the speed penalty is manageable here as the sieve reasonably fits in memory.

Once we have the table of primes, we are left with a relatively easy programming exercise: for each prime \(P \leq N\), we must check all smaller primes \(p \leq P\) and count the ones that are \(P - p\).

In practice, we will use an array \(\mathit{isP}\) to store the primality status. Then we just want the number of numbers \(k = j - i\) with \(i < j \leq N\) and such that both \(i\) and \(j\) are marked as prime by the sieve.

We'll need to use a sieve to generate all primes up to \(N\). Given that \(N\) can be up to \(10{,}000{,}000\), even the Sieve of Eratosthenes will suffice for generating primes efficiently within these constraints.

Once we have the list of primes, we then count the number of integers that can be expressed as the difference between two primes, ensuring the result is also prime. Then, we can efficiently iterate over the range \(1 \le i \le N\) and use precomputed sums to find the number of \(N\)-subtractorizations.

Here's the implementation of the algorithm:

# Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> primes;

void sieve(int N) {
  primes.resize(N+1, true);
  primes[1] = false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; i++) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = i * i; j <= N; j += i) {
        primes[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
}

vector<int> prime_diffs;

void count_prime_diffs(int N) {
  for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
    if (primes[i]) {
      for (int j = 1; i + j <= N && primes[i + j]; j += 2) {
        prime_diffs[i + j]++;
      }
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int T;
  cin >> T;
  for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
  
    sieve(N);
    prime_diffs.resize(N+1, 0);
    count_prime_diffs(N);
  
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) if (primes[i] && prime_diffs[i]) ans++;
  
    cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The sieve generates all prime numbers up to \(N\). The function `count_prime_diffs` computes the number of times each integer up to \(N\) can be written as the difference of two primes. Finally, the main loop identifies the number of \(N\)-subtractorizations, which are prime numbers whose prime differences are also prime.

Given a value \(N\):

1. Generate all primes up to \(N\) using Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For every two distinct primes \(p1\) and \(p2\), calculate \(diff = |p1 - p2|\)
3. Insert each \(diff\) into a set (Set assures no duplicates).
4. Count the entries in the set.

Implementation:

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= N; ++p) {
        if (is_prime[p]) {
            for (int i = p * p; i <= N; i += p) {
                is_prime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {

    cin >> T;
    for (int t = 1; t <= T; t++) {
        cin >> N;
        vector<bool> is_prime(N + 1);
        sieve(is_prime, N);

        set<int> subtractorizations;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
            if (!is_prime[i]) continue;
            for (int j = i; j <= N; j++) {
                if (!is_prime[j]) continue;
                subtractorizations.insert(abs(i - j));
            }
        }

        cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << subtractorizations.size() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This solution leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate all prime numbers up to \(N\). It then calculates differences between all pairs of these primes to determine unique *$N$-subtractorizations*. Summarizing, we cover all necessary constraints and complexity requirements for efficient operation.

Generate all primes up to \(N\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For each prime number \(p_i\) less than or equal to \(N\), check if it can be expressed as a difference \(p_j - p_k\) where both \(p_j\) and \(p_k\) are less than or equal to \(N\). Especially pay attention to number 2. If 2 is prime, include all such subtractorizations; otherwise, exclude it.

To improve performance, avoid unnecessary calculations by only considering primes up to \(\frac{N}{2}\). This is because if \(p_i\) is greater than \(\frac{N}{2}\), then the resulting difference \(p_i - p_j\) for any prime \(p_j\) will exceed \(N\).
